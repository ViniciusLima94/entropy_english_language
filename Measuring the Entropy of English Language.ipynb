       "'the life and adventures of robinson crusoe by daniel de foe london 18o8 illustration i had one labour to make me a canoe which at last i finished the life of de foe daniel de foe was descended from a respectable family in the county of northampton and born in london about the year 1663 his father james foe was a butcher in the parish of st giles s cripplegate and a protestant dissenter why the subject of this memoir prefixed the de to his family name cannot now be ascertained nor did he at any period of his life think it necessary to give his reasons to the public the political scribblers of the day however thought proper to remedy this lack of information and accused him of possessing so little of the amor patriae as to make the addition in order that he might not be taken for an englishman though this idea could have had no other foundation than the circumstance of his having in consequence of his zeal for king william attacked the prejudices of his countrymen in his true born englishman after receiving a good education at an academy at newington young de foe before he had attained his twenty first year commenced his career as an author by writing a pamphlet against a very prevailing sentiment in favour of the turks who were at that time laying siege to vienna this production being very inferior to those of his maturer years was very little read and the indignant author despairing of success with his pen had recourse to the sword or as he termed it when boasting of the exploit in his latter years displayed his attachment to liberty and protestantism by joining the ill advised insurrection under the duke of monmouth in the west on the failure of that unfortunate enterprise he returned again to the metropolis and it is not improbable but that the circumstance of his being a native of london and his person not much known in that part of the kingdom where the rebellion took place might facilitate his escape and be the means of preventing his being brought to trial for his share in the transaction with the professions of a writer and a soldier mr de foe in the year 1685 joined that of a trader he was first engaged as a hosier in cornhill and afterwards as a maker of bricks and pantiles near tilbury fort in essex but in consequence of spending those hours in the hilarity of the tavern which he ought to have employed in the calculations of the counting house his commercial schemes proved unsuccessful and in 1694 he was obliged to abscond from his creditors not failing to attribute those misfortunes to the war and the severity of the times which were doubtless owing to his own misconduct it is much to his credit however that after having been freed from his debts by composition and being in prosperous circumstances from king william s favour he voluntarily paid most of his creditors both the principal and interest of their claims this is such an example of honesty as it would be unjust to de foe and to the world to conceal the amount of the sums thus paid must have been very considerable as he afterwards feelingly mentions to lord haversham who had reproached him with covetousness with a numerous family and no helps but my own industry i have forced my way through a sea of misfortunes and reduced my debts exclusive of composition from seventeen thousand to less than five thousand pounds at the beginning of the year 1700 mr de foe published a satire in verse which excited very considerable attention called the true born englishman its purpose was to furnish a reply to those who were continually abusing king william and some of his friends as foreigners by shewing that the present race of englishmen was a mixed and heterogeneous brood scarcely any of which could lay claim to native purity of blood the satire was in many parts very severe and though it gave high offence it claimed a considerable share of the public attention the reader will perhaps be gratified by a specimen of this production wherein he endeavours to account for what makes this discontented land appear less happy now in times of peace than war why civil feuds disturb the nation more than all our bloody wars had done before fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place and men are always honest in disgrace the court preferments make men knaves in course but they who would be in them would be worse tis not at foreigners that we repine would foreigners their perquisites resign the grand contention s plainly to be seen to get some men put out and some put in it will be immediately perceived that de foe could have no pretentious to the character of a poet but he has notwithstanding some nervous and well versified lines and in choice of subject and moral he is in general excellent the true born englishman concludes thus could but our ancestors retrieve their fate and see their offspring thus degenerate how we contend for birth and names unknown and build on their past actions not our own they d cancel records and their tombs deface and openly disown the vile degenerate race for fame of families is all a cheat tis personal virtue only makes us great for this defence of foreigners de foe was amply rewarded by king william who not only ordered him a pension but as his opponents denominated it appointed him pamphlet writer general to the court an office for which he was peculiarly well calculated possessing with a strong mind and a ready wit that kind of yielding conscience which allowed him to support the measures of his benefactors though convinced they were injurious to his country de foe now retired to newington with his family and for a short time lived at ease but the death of his royal patron deprived him of a generous protector and opened a scene of sorrow which probably embittered his future life he had always discovered a great inclination to engage in religious controversy and the furious contest civil and ecclesiastical which ensued on the accession of queen anne gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion he therefore published a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution but written in so serious a strain that many persons particularly dissenters at first mistook its real intention the high church party however saw and felt the ridicule and by their influence a prosecution was commenced against him and a proclamation published in the gazette offering a reward for his apprehension 1 when de foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to be treated he at first secreted himself but his printer and bookseller being taken into custody he surrendered being resolved as he expresses it to throw himself upon the favour of government rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes in july 1703 he was brought to trial found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned to stand in the pillory and to pay a fine of two hundred marks he underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity so far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself that he wrote a hymn to the pillory which thus ends alluding to his accusers tell them the men that plac d him here are scandals to the times are at a loss to find his guilt and can t commit his crimes pope who has thought fit to introduce him in his dunciad probably from no other reason than party difference characterises him in the following line earless on high stood unabash d de foe footnote 1 st james s january 10 1702 3 whereas daniel de foe alias de fooe is charged with writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet entitled the shortest way with the dissenters he is a middle sized spare man about 40 years old of a brown complexion and dark brown coloured hair but wears a wig a hooked nose a sharp chin grey eyes and a large mole near his mouth was born in london and for many years was a hose factor in freeman s yard in cornhill and now is owner of the brick and pantile works near tilbury fort in essex whoever shall discover the said daniel de foe to one of her majesty s principal secretaries of state or any of her majesty s justices of peace so as he may be apprehended shall have a reward of 50 l which her majesty has ordered immediately to be paid upon such discovery london gaz no 3679 this is one of those instances of injustice and malignity which so frequently occur in the dunciad and which reflect more dishonour on the author than on the parties traduced de foe lay friendless and distressed in newgate his family ruined and himself without hopes of deliverance till sir robert harley who approved of his principles and foresaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to many uses represented his unmerited sufferings to the queen and at length procured his release the treasurer lord godolphin also sent a considerable sum to his wife and family and to him money to pay his fine and the expense of his discharge gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man and it was this benevolent act that prompted de foe to support harley with his able and ingenious pen when anne lay lifeless and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was persecuted by faction and overpowered though not conquered by violence the talents and perseverance of de foe began now to be properly estimated and as a firm supporter of the administration he was sent by lord godolphin to scotland on an errand which as he says was far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an honest man to perform his knowledge of commerce and revenue his powers of insinuation and above all his readiness of pen were deemed of no small utility in promoting the union of the two kingdoms of which he wrote an able history in 1709 with two dedications one to the queen and another to the duke of queensbury soon afterwards he unhappily by some equivocal writings rendered himself suspected by both parties so that he once more retired to newington in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace his pension being withdrawn and wearied with politics he began to compose works of a different kind the year 1715 may therefore be regarded as the period of de foe s political life faction henceforth found other advocates and parties procured other writers to disseminate their suggestions and to propagate their falsehoods in 1715 de foe published the family instructor a work inculcating the domestic duties in a lively manner by narration and dialogue and displaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society religious courtship also appeared soon after which like the family instructor is eminently religious and moral in its tendency and strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety and private devotion for which the dissenters have generally been distinguished the most celebrated of all his works the life and adventures of robinson crusoe appeared in 1719 this work has passed through numerous editions and been translated into almost all modern languages the great invention which is displayed in it the variety of incidents and circumstances which it contains related in the most easy and natural manner together with the excellency of the moral and religious reflections render it a performance of very superior and uncommon merit and one of the most interesting works that ever appeared it is strongly recommended by rosseau as a book admirably calculated to promote the purposes of natural education and dr blair says no fiction in any language was ever better supported than the adventures of robinson crusoe while it is carried on with that appearance of truth and simplicity which takes a strong hold of the imagination of all readers it suggests at the same time very useful instruction by shewing how much the native powers of man may be exerted for surmounting the difficulties of any external situation it has been pretended that de foe surreptitiously appropriated the papers of alexander selkirk a scotch mariner who lived four years alone on the island of juan fernandez and a sketch of whose story had before appeared in the voyage of captain woodes rogers but this charge though repeatedly and confidently brought appears to be totally destitute of any foundation de foe probably took some general hints for his work from the story of selkirk but there exists no proof whatever nor is it reasonable to suppose that he possessed any of his papers or memoirs which had been published seven years before the appearance of robinson crusoe as a farther proof of de foe s innocence captain rogers s account of selkirk may be produced in which it is said that the latter had neither preserved pen ink or paper and had in a great measure lost his language consequently de foe could not have received any written assistance and we have only the assertion of his enemies to prove that he had any verbal the great success of robinson crusoe induced its author to write a number of other lives and adventures some of which were popular in their times though at present nearly forgotten one of his latest publications was a tour through the island of great britain a performance of very inferior merit but de foe was now the garrulous old man and his spirit to use the words of an ingenious biographer like a candle struggling in the socket blazed and sunk blazed and sunk till it disappeared at length in total darkness his laborious and unfortunate life was finished on the 26th of april 1731 in the parish of st giles s cripplegate daniel de foe possessed very extraordinary talents as a commercial writer he is fairly entitled to stand in the foremost rank among his contemporaries whatever may be their performances or their fame his distinguishing characteristics are originality spirit and a profound knowledge of his subject and in these particulars he has seldom been surpassed as the author of robinson crusoe he has a claim not only to the admiration but to the gratitude of his countrymen and so long as we have a regard for supereminent merit and take an interest in the welfare of the rising generation that gratitude will not cease to exist but the opinion of the learned and ingenious dr beattie will be the best eulogium that can be pronounced on that celebrated romance robinson crusoe says the doctor must be allowed by the most rigid moralist to be one of those novels which one may read not only with pleasure but also with profit it breathes throughout a spirit of piety and benevolence it sets in a very striking light the importance of the mechanic arts which they who know not what it is to be without them are so apt to undervalue it fixes in the mind a lively idea of the horrors of solitude and consequently of the sweets of social life and of the blessings we derive from conversation and mutual aid and it shews how by labouring with one s own hands one may secure independence and open for one s self many sources of health and amusement i agree therefore with rosseau that it is one of the best books that can be put into the hands of children g d the life and adventures of robinson crusoe c c i was born in the year 1632 in the city of york of a good family though not of that country my father being a foreigner of bremen who settled first at hull he got a good estate by merchandise and leaving off his trade lived afterwards at york from whence he had married my mother whose relations were named robinson a very good family in that country and from whom i was called robinson kreutznaer but by the usual corruption of words in england we are now called nay we call ourselves and write our name crusoe and so my companions always called me i had two elder brothers one of which was lieutenant colonel to an english regiment of foot in flanders formerly commanded by the famous colonel lockhart and was killed at the battle near dunkirk against the spaniards what became of my second brother i never knew any more than my father or mother did know what was become of me being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts my father who was very ancient had given me a competent share of learning as far as house education and a country free school generally go and designed me for the law but i would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will nay the commands of my father and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends that there seemed to be something fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to the life of misery which was to befal me my father a wise and grave man gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design he called me one morning into his chamber where he was confined by the gout and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject he asked me what reasons more than a mere wandering inclination i had for leaving my father s house and my native country where i might be well introduced and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry with a life of ease and pleasure he told me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one hand or of aspiring superior fortunes on the other who went abroad upon adventures to rise by enterprise and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me that mine was the middle state or what might be called the upper station of low life which he had found by long experience was the best state in the world the most suited to human happiness not exposed to the miseries and hardships the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind and not embarrassed with the pride luxury ambition and envy of the upper part of mankind he told me i might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing viz that this was the state of life which all other people envied that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being born to great things and wish they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes between the mean and the great that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the just standard of true felicity when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches he bid me observe it and i should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind but that the middle station had the fewest disasters and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind nay they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses either of body or mind as those were who by vicious living luxury and extravagances on one hand or by hard labour want of necessaries and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand bring distempers upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of enjoyments that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune that temperance moderation quietness health society all agreeable diversions and all desirable pleasures were the blessings attending the middle station of life that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world and comfortably out of it not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread or harassed with perplexed circumstances which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest not enraged with the passion of envy or secret burning lust of ambition for great things but in easy circumstances sliding gently through the world and sensibly tasting the sweets of living without the bitter feeling that they are happy and learning by every day s experience to know it more sensibly after this he pressed me earnestly and in the most affectionate manner not to play the young man not to precipitate myself into miseries which nature and the station of life i was born in seemed to have provided against that i was under no necessity of seeking my bread that he would do well for me and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been just recommending to me and that if i was not very easy and happy in the world it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it and that he should have nothing to answer for having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt in a word that as he would do very kind things for me if i would stay and settle at home as he directed so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an example to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the low country wars but could not prevail his young desires prompting him to run into the army where he was killed and though he said he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if i did take this foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery i observed in this last part of his discourse which was truly prophetic though i suppose my father did not know it to be so himself i say i observed the tears run down his face very plentifully and especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent and none to assist me he was so moved that he broke off the discourse and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me i was sincerely affected with this discourse as indeed who could be otherwise and i resolved not to think of going abroad any more but to settle at home according to my father s desire but alas a few days wore it all off and in short to prevent any of my father s farther importunities in a few weeks after i resolved to run quite away from him however i did not act so hastily neither as my first heat of resolution prompted but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that i should never settle to any thing with resolution enough to go through with it and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it that i was now eighteen years old which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i was sure if i did i should never serve out my time and i should certainly run away from my master before my time was out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promise by a double diligence to recover that time i had lost this put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to any such thing so much for my hurt and that she wondered how i could think of any such thing after such a discourse as i had had with my father and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me and that in short if i would ruin myself there was no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction and i should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not though my mother refused to move it to my father yet as i have heard afterwards she reported all the discourse to him and that my father after shewing a great concern at it said to her with a sigh that boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch that was ever born i can give no consent to it it was not till almost a year after this that i broke loose though in the meantime i continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business and frequently expostulating with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to but being one day at hull where i went casually and without any purpose of making an elopement that time but i say being there and one of my companions being going by sea to london in his father s ship and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men viz that it should cost me nothing for my passage i consulted neither father or mother any more not so much as sent them word of it but leaving them to hear of it as they might without asking god s blessing or my father s without any consideration of circumstances or consequences and in an ill hour god knows on the first of september 1651 i went on board a ship bound for london never any young adventurer s misfortunes i believe began sooner or continued longer than mine the ship was no sooner gotten out of the humber but the wind began to blow and the waves to rise in a most frightful manner and as i had never been at sea before i was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind i began now seriously to reflect upon what i had done and how justly i was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father s house and abandoning my duty all the good counsel of my parents my father s tears and my mother s entreaties came now fresh into my mind and my conscience which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since reproached me with the contempt of advice and the breach of my duty to god and my father all this while the storm increased and the sea which i had never been upon before went very high though nothing like what i have seen many times since no nor like what i saw a few days after but it was enough to affect me then who was but a young sailor and had never known any thing of the matter i expected every wave would have swallowed us up and that every time the ship fell down as i thought in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more and in this agony of mind i made many vows and resolutions that if it would please god here to spare my life this one voyage if ever i got once my foot upon dry land again i would go directly home to my father and never set it into a ship again while i lived that i would take his advice and never run myself into such miseries as these any more now i saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life how easy how comfortably he had lived all his days and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore and i resolved that i would like a true repenting prodigal go home to my father these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm continued and indeed some time after but the next day the wind was abated and the sea calmer and i began to be a little inured to it however i was very grave for all that day being also a little sea sick still but towards night the weather cleared up the wind was quite over and a charming fine evening followed the sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next morning and having little or no wind and a smooth sea the sun shining upon it the sight was as i thought the most delightful that ever i saw i had slept well in the night and was now no more sea sick but very cheerful looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time after and now lest my good resolutions should continue my companion who had indeed enticed me away comes to me well bob says he clapping me upon the shoulder how do you do after it i warrant you were frighted wa n t you last night when it blew but a capful of wind a capful do you call it said i it was a terrible storm a storm you fool you replied he do you call that a storm why it was nothing at all give us but a good ship and sea room and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that but you re but a fresh water sailor bob come let us make a bowl of punch and we ll forget all that do you see what charming weather it is now to make short this sad part of my story we went the old way of all sailors the punch was made and i was made drunk with it and in that one night s wickedness i drowned all my repentance all my reflections upon my past conduct and all my resolutions for my future in a word as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm so the hurry of my thoughts being over my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten and the current of my former desires returned i entirely forgot the vows and promises that i made in my distress i found indeed some intervals of reflection and the serious thoughts did as it were endeavour to return again sometimes but i shook them off and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper and applying myself to drinking and company soon mastered the return of those fits for so i called them and i had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire but i was to have another trial for it still and providence as in such cases generally it does resolved to leave me entirely without excuse for if i would not take this for a deliverance the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy the sixth day of our being at sea we came into yarmouth roads the wind having been contrary and the weather calm we had made but little way since the storm here we were obliged to come to anchor and here we lay the wind continuing contrary viz at south west for seven or eight days during which time a great many ships from newcastle came into the same roads as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river we had not however rid here so long but should have tided it up the river but that the wind blew too fresh and after we had lain four or five days blew very hard however the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour the anchorage good and our ground tackle very strong our men were unconcerned and not in the least apprehensive of danger but spent the time in rest and mirth after the manner of the sea but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts and make every thing snug and close that the ship might ride as easy as possible by noon the sea went very high indeed and our ship rid forecastle in shipped several seas and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor so that we rode with two anchors ahead and the cables veered out to the better end by this time it blew a terrible storm indeed and now i began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves the master though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me i could hear him softly to himself say several times lord be merciful to us we shall be all lost we shall be all undone and the like during these first hurries i was stupid lying still in my cabin which was in the steerage and cannot describe my temper i could ill reassume the first penitence which i had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against i thought the bitterness of death had been past and that this would be nothing like the first but when the master himself came by me as i said just now and said we should be all lost i was dreadfully frighted i got up out of my cabin and looked out but such a dismal sight i never saw the sea went mountains high and broke upon us every three or four minutes when i could look about i could see nothing but distress round us two ships that rid near us we found had cut their masts by the board being deep loaden and our men cried out that a ship which rid about a mile ahead of us was foundered two more ships being driven from their anchors were run out of the roads to sea at all adventures and that with not a mast standing the light ships fared the best as not so much labouring in the sea but two or three of them drove and came close by us running away with only their sprit sail out before the wind towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore mast which he was very unwilling to do but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would founder he consented and when they had cut away the fore mast the main mast stood so loose and shook the ship so much they were obliged to cut her away also and make a clear deck any one may judge what a condition i must be in at all this who was but a young sailor and who had been in such a fright before at but a little but if i can express at this distance the thoughts i had about me at that time i was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions and the having returned from them to the resolutions i had wickedly taken at first than i was at death itself and these added to the terror of the storm put me in such a condition that i can by no words describe it but the worst was not come yet the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse we had a good ship but she was deep loaden and wallowed in the sea that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder it was my advantage in one respect that i did not know what they meant by founder till i inquired however the storm was so violent that i saw what is not often seen the master the boatswain and some others more sensible than the rest at their prayers and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom in the middle of the night and under all the rest of our distresses one of the men that had been down on purpose to see cried out we had sprang a leak another said there was four foot water in the hold then all hands were called to the pump at that very word my heart as i thought died within me and i fell backwards upon the side of my bed where i sat into the cabin however the men roused me and told me that i that was able to do nothing before was as well able to pump as another at which i stirred up and went to the pump and worked very heartily while this was doing the master seeing some light colliers who not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and run away to sea and would come near us ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress i who knew nothing what that meant was so surprised that i thought the ship had broke or some dreadful thing happened in a word i was so surprised that i fell down in a swoon as this was a time when every body had his own life to think of nobody minded me or what was become of me but another man stept up to the pump and thrusting me aside with his foot let me lie thinking i had been dead and it was a great while before i came to myself we worked on but the water increasing in the hold it was apparent that the ship would founder and though the storm began to abate a little yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a port so the master continued firing guns for help and a light ship who had rid it out just ahead of us ventured a boat out to help us it was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us but it was impossible for as to get on board or for the boat to lie near the ship s side till at last the men rowing very heartily and venturing their lives to save ours our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it and then veered it out a great length which they after great labour and hazard took hold of and we hauled them close under our stern and got all into their boat it was to no purpose for them or us after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship so all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could and our master promised them that if the boat was staved upon shore he would make it good to their master so partly rowing and partly driving our boat went away to the northward sloping towards the shore almost as far as winterton ness we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but we saw her sink and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking for from that moment they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in my heart was as it were dead within me partly with fright partly with horror of mind and the thoughts of what was yet before me while we were in this condition the men yet labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore we could see when our boat mounting the waves we were able to see the shore a great many people running along the shore to assist us when we should come near but we made but slow way towards the shore nor were we able to reach the shore till being past the light house at winterton the shore falls off to the westward towards cromer and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind here we got in and though not without much difficulty got all safe on shore and walked afterwards on foot to yarmouth where as unfortunate men we were used with great humanity as well by the magistrates of the town who assigned us good quarters as by particular merchants and owners of ships and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to london or back to hull as we thought fit had i now had the sense to have gone back to hull and have gone home i had been happy and my father an emblem of our blessed saviour s parable had even killed the fatted calf for me for hearing the ship i went away in was cast away in yarmouth roads it was a great while before he had any assurance that i was not drowned but my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist and though i had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home yet i had no power to do it i know not what to call this nor will i urge that it is a secret over ruling decree that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction even though it be before us and that we push upon it with our eyes open certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending and which it was impossible for me to escape could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts and against two such visible instructions as i had met with in my first attempt my comrade who had helped to harden me before and who was the master s son was now less forward than i the first time he spoke to me after we were at yarmouth which was not till two or three days for we were separated in the town to several quarters i say the first time he saw me it appeared his tone was altered and looking very melancholy and shaking his head asked me how i did and telling his father who i was and how i had come this voyage only for a trial in order to go farther abroad his father turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone young man says he you ought never to go to sea any more you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man why sir said i will you go to sea no more that is another case said he it is my calling and therefore my duty but as you made this voyage for a trial you see what a taste heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist perhaps this is all befallen us on your account like jonah in the ship of tarshish pray continues he what are you and on what account did you go to sea upon that i told him some of my story at the end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion what had i done says he that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship i would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds this indeed was as i said an excursion of his spirits which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss and was farther than he could have authority to go however he afterwards talked very gravely to me exhorted me to go back to my father and not tempt providence to my ruin told me i might see a visible hand of heaven against me and young man said he depend upon it if you do not go back wherever you go you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments till your father s words are fulfilled upon you we parted soon after for i made him little answer and i saw him no more which way he went i know not as for me having some money in my pocket i travelled to london by land and there as well as on the road had many struggles with myself what course of life i should take and whether i should go home or go to sea as to going home shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours and should be ashamed to see not my father and mother only but even every body else from whence i have since often observed how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is especially of youth to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases viz that they are not ashamed to sin and yet are ashamed to repent nor ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools but are ashamed of the returning which only can make them be esteemed wise men in this state of life however i remained some time uncertain what measures to take and what course of life to lead an irresistible reluctance continued to going home and as i stayed a while the remembrance of the distress i had been in wore off and as that abated the little motion i had in my desires to a return wore off with it till at last i quite laid aside the thoughts of it and looked out for a voyage that evil influence which carried me first away from my father s house that hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice and to the entreaties and even the command of my father i say the same influence whatever it was presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa or as our sailors vulgarly call it a voyage to guinea it was my great misfortune that in all these adventures i did not ship myself as a sailor whereby though i might indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary yet at the same time i had learnt the duty and office of a foremastman and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant if not for a master but as it was always my fate to choose for the worse so i did here for having money in my pocket and good clothes upon my back i would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman and so i neither had any business in the ship or learnt to do any it was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in london which does not always happen to such loose and unguided young fellows as i then was the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them very early but it was not so with me i first fell acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of guinea and who having had very good success there was resolved to go again and who taking a fancy to my conversation which was not at all disagreeable at that time hearing me say i had a mind to see the world told me if i would go the voyage with him i should be at no expense i should be his messmate and his companion and if i could carry any thing with me i should have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit and perhaps i might meet with some encouragement i embraced the offer and entering into a strict friendship with this captain who was an honest and plain dealing man i went the voyage with him and carried a small adventure with me which by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain i increased very considerably for i carried about 40 l in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy this 40 l i had mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations whom i corresponded with and who i believe got my father or at least my mother to contribute so much as that to my first adventure this was the only voyage which i may say was successful in all my adventures and which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain under whom also i got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation learnt how to keep an account of the ship s course take an observation and in short to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor for as he took delight to instruct me i took delight to learn and in a word this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure which yielded me in london at my return almost 300 l and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have so completed my ruin yet even in this voyage i had my misfortunes too particularly that i was continually sick being thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate our principal trading being upon the coast from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself i was now set up for a guinea trader and my friend to my great misfortune dying soon after his arrival i resolved to go the same voyage again and i embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage and had now got the command of the ship this was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made for though i did not carry quite 100 l of my new gained wealth so that i had 200 l left and which i lodged with my friend s widow who was very just to me yet i fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage and the first was this viz our ship making her course towards the canary islands or rather between those islands and the african shore was surprised in the grey of the morning by a turkish rover of sallee who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make we crowded also as much canvass as our yards would spread or our masts carry to have got clear but finding the pirate gained upon us and would certainly come up with us in a few hours we prepared to fight our ship having twelve guns and the rogue eighteen about three in the afternoon he came up with us and bringing to by mistake just athwart our quarter instead of athwart our stern as he intended we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side and poured in a broadside upon him which made him sheer off again after returning our fire and pouring in also his small shot from near 200 men which he had on board however we had not a man touched all our men keeping close he prepared to attack us again and we to defend ourselves but laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter he entered sixty men upon our decks who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging we plied them with small shot half pikes powder cheats and such like and cleared our deck of them twice however to cut short this melancholy part of our story our ship being disabled and three of our men killed and eight wounded we were obliged to yield and were carried all prisoners into sallee a port belonging to the moors the usage i had there was not so dreadful as at first i apprehended nor was i carried up the country to the emperor s court as the rest of our men were but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize and made his slave being young and nimble and fit for his business at this surprising change of my circumstances from a merchant to a miserable slave i was perfectly overwhelmed and now i looked back upon my father s prophetic discourse to me that i should be miserable and have none to relieve me which i thought was now so effectually brought to pass that i could not be worse that now the hand of heaven had overtaken me and i was undone without redemption but alas this was but a taste of the misery i was to go through as will appear in the sequel of this story as my new patron or master had taken me home to his house so i was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again believing that it would sometime or other be his fate to be taken by a spanish or portugal man of war and that then i should be set at liberty but this hope of mine was soon taken away for when he went to sea he left me on shore to look after his little garden and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house and when he came home again from his cruise he ordered me to be in the cabin to look after the ship here i meditated nothing but my escape and what method i might take to effect it but found no way that had the least probability in it nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational for i had nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me no fellow slave no englishman irishman or scotsman there but myself so that for two years though i often pleased myself with the imagination yet i never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice after about two years an odd circumstance presented itself which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship which as i heard was for want of money he used constantly once or twice a week sometimes oftener if the weather was fair to take the ship s pinnace and go out into the road a fishing and as he always took me and a young maresco with him to row the boat we made him very merry and i proved very dexterous in catching fish insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor one of his kinsmen and the youth the maresco as they called him to catch a dish of fish for him it happened one time that going a fishing in a stark calm morning a fog rose so thick that though we were not half a league from the shore we lost sight of it and rowing we knew not whither or which way we laboured all day and all the next night and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore and that we were at least two leagues from the shore however we got well in again though with a great deal of labour and some danger for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning but particularly we were all very hungry but our patron warned by this disaster resolved to take more care of himself for the future and having lying by him the long boat of our english ship he had taken he resolved he would not go a fishing any more without a compass and some provision so he ordered the carpenter of his ship who also was an english slave to build a little state room or cabin in the middle of the long boat like that of a barge with a place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the main sheet and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails she sailed with that we call a shoulder of mutton sail and the boom gibed over the top of the cabin which lay very snug and low and had in it room for him to lie with a slave or two and a table to eat on with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink particularly his bread rice and coffee we went frequently out with this boat a fishing and as i was most dexterous to catch fish for him he never went without me it happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat either for pleasure or for fish with two or three moors of some distinction in that place and for whom he had provided extraordinarily and had therefore sent on board the boat over night a larger store of provisions than ordinary and had ordered me to get ready three fuzees with powder and shot which were on board his ship for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing i got all things ready as he had directed and waited the next morning with the boat washed clean her ancient and pendants out and every thing to accommodate his guests when by and by my patron came on board alone and told me his guests had put off going upon some business that fell out and ordered me with the man and boy as usual to go out with the boat and catch them some fish for that his friends were to sup at his house and commanded that as soon as i got some fish i should bring it home to his house all which i prepared to do this moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts for now i found i was like to have a little ship at my command and my master being gone i prepared to furnish myself not for fishing business but for a voyage though i knew not neither did i so much as consider whither i should steer for any where to get out of that place was my way my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor to get something for our subsistence on board for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron s bread he said that was true so he brought a large basket of rusk or bisket of their kind and three jars with fresh water into the boat i knew where my patron s case of bottles stood which it was evident by the make were taken out of some english prize and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore as if they had been there before for our master i conveyed also a great lump of bees wax into the boat which weighed above half a hundred weight with a parcel of twine or thread a hatchet a saw and a hammer all which were of great use to us afterwards especially the wax to make candles another trick i tried upon him which he innocently came into also his name was ismael whom they call muly or moley so i called to him moley said i our patron s guns are on board the boat can you not get a little powder and shot it may be we may kill some alcamies a fowl like our curlews for ourselves for i know he keeps the gunner s stores in the ship yes says he i ll bring some and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch which held about a pound and a half of powder or rather more and another with shot that had five or six pounds with some bullets and put all into the boat at the same time i had found some powder of my master s in the great cabin with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case which was almost empty pouring what was in it into another and thus furnished with every thing needful we sailed out of the port to fish the castle which is at the entrance of the port knew who we were and took no notice of us and we were not above a mile out of the port before we haled in our sail and set us down to fish the wind blew from the n n e which was contrary to my desire for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain and at last reached to the bay of cadiz but my resolutions were blow which way it would i would be gone from that horrid place where i was and leave the rest to fate after we had fished some time and catched nothing for when i had fish on my hook i would not pull them up that he might not see them i said to the moor this will not do our master will not be thus served we must stand farther off he thinking no harm agreed and being in the head of the boat set the sails and as i had the helm i ran the boat out near a league farther and then brought her to as if i would fish when giving the boy the helm i stepped forward to where the moor was and making as if i stooped for something behind him i took him by surprise with my arm under his twist and tossed him clear overboard into the sea he rose immediately for he swam like a cork and called to me begged to be taken in told me he would go all over the world with me he swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me very quickly there being but little wind upon which i stepped into the cabin and fetching one of the fowling pieces i presented it at him and told him i had done him no hurt and if he would be quiet i would do him none but said i you swim well enough to reach to the shore and the sea is calm make the best of your way to shore and i will do you no harm but if you come near the boat i ll shoot you through the head for i am resolved to have my liberty so he turned himself about and swam for the shore and i make no doubt but he reached it with ease for he was an excellent swimmer i could have been content to have taken this moor with me and have drowned the boy but there was no venturing to trust him when he was gone i turned to the boy whom they called xury and said to him xury if you will be faithful to me i ll make you a great man but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me that is swear by mahomet and his father s beard i must throw you into the sea too the boy smiled in my face and spoke so innocently that i could not mistrust him and swore to be faithful to me and go all over the world with me while i was in view of the moor that was swimming i stood out directly to sea with the boat rather stretching to windward that they might think me gone towards the straits mouth as indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward to the truly barbarian coast where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with the canoes and destroy us where we could never once go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts or more merciless savages of human kind but as soon as it grew dusk in the evening i changed my course and steered directly south and by east bending my course a little toward the east that i might keep in with the shore and having a fair fresh gale of wind and a smooth quiet sea i made such sail that i believe by the next day at three o clock in the afternoon when i first made the land i could not be less than 150 miles south of sallee quite beyond the emperor of morocco s dominions or indeed of any other king thereabouts for we saw no people yet such was the fright i had taken at the moors and the dreadful apprehensions i had of falling into their hands that i would not stop or go on shore or come to an anchor the wind continuing fair till i had sailed in that manner five days and then the wind shifting to the southward i concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me they also would now give over so i ventured to make to the coast and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little river i knew not what or where neither what latitude what country what nation or what river i neither saw or desired to see any people the principal thing i wanted was fresh water we came into this creek in the evening resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark and discover the country but as soon as it was quite dark we heard such dreadful noises of the barking roaring and howling of wild creatures of we knew not what kinds that the poor boy was ready to die with fear and begged of me not to go on shore till day well xury said i then i won t but it may be we may see men by day who will be as bad to us as those lions then we give them the shoot gun says xury laughing make them run wey such english xury spoke by conversing among us slaves however i was glad to see the boy so cheerful and i gave him a dram out of our patron s case of bottles to cheer him up after all xury s advice was good and i took it we dropped our little anchor and lay still all night i say still for we slept none for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures we knew not what to call them of many sorts come down to the sea shore and run into the water wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves and they made such hideous howlings and yellings that i never indeed heard the like xury was dreadfully frighted and indeed so was i too but we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat we could not see him but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast xury said it was a lion and it might be so for aught i know but poor xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away no says i xury we can slip our cable with the buoy to it and go off to sea they cannot follow us far i had no sooner said so but i perceived the creature whatever it was within two oars length which something surprised me however i immediately stepped to the cabin door and taking up my gun fired at him upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore again but it is impossible to describe the horrible noises and hideous cries and howlings that were raised as well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the country upon the noise or report of the gun a thing i have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before this convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast and how to venture on shore in the day was another question too for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it be that as it would we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other for water for we had not a pint left in the boat when or where to get it was the point xury said if i would let him go on shore with one of the jars he would find if there was any water and bring some to me i asked him why he would go why i should not go and he stay in the boat the boy answered with so much affection that made me love him ever after says he if wild mans come they eat me you go wey well xury said i we will both go and if the wild mans come we will kill them they shall eat neither of us so i gave xury a piece of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our patron s case of bottles which i mentioned before and we haled the boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper and waded on shore carrying nothing but our arms and two jars for water i did not care to go out of sight of the boat fearing the coming of canoes with savages down the river but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country rambled to it and by and by i saw him come running towards me i thought he was pursued by some savage or frighted with some wild beast and i run forward towards him to help him but when i came nearer to him i saw something hanging over his shoulders which was a creature that he had shot like a hare but different in colour and longer legs however we were very glad of it and it was very good meat but the great joy that poor xury came with was to tell me that he had found good water and seen no wild mans but we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water for a little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide was out which flows but a little way up so we filled our jars and feasted on the hare we had killed and prepared to go on our way having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country as i had been one voyage to this coast before i knew very well that the islands of the canaries and the cape de verd islands also lay not far off from the coast but as i had no instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we were in and not exactly knowing or at least remembering what latitude they were in and knew not where to look for them or when to stand off to sea towards them otherwise i might now easily have found some of these islands but my hope was that if i stood along this coast till i came to that part where the english traded i should find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade that would relieve and take us in by the best of my calculation that place where i now was must be that country which lying between the emperor of morocco s dominions and the negroes lies waste and uninhabited except by wild beasts the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the moors and the moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers lions leopards and other furious creatures which harbour there so that the moors use it for their hunting only where they go like an army two or three thousand men at a time and indeed for near an hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night once or twice in the daytime i thought i saw the pico of teneriffe being the high top of the mountain teneriffe in the canaries and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither but having tried twice i was forced in again by contrary winds the sea also going too high for my little vessel so i resolved to pursue my first design and keep along the shore several times i was obliged to land for fresh water after we had left this place and once in particular being early in the morning we came to an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty high and the tide beginning to flow we lay still to go farther in xury whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were calls softly to me and tells me that we had best go farther off the shore for says he look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep i looked where he pointed and saw a dreadful monster indeed for it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him xury says i you shall go on shore and kill him xury looked frighted and said me kill he eat me at one mouth one mouthful he meant however i said no more to the boy but had him lie still and i took our biggest gun which was almost musket bore and loaded it with a good charge of powder and with two slugs and laid it down then i loaded another gun with two bullets and the third for we had three pieces i loaded with five smaller bullets i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him into the head but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone he started up growling at first but finding his leg broke fell down again and then got up upon three legs and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head however i look up the second piece immediately and though he began to move off fired again and shot him into the head and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise but he struggling for life then xury took heart and would have me let him go on shore well go said i so the boy jumped into the water and taking a little gun in one hand swam to shore with the other hand and coming close to the creature put the muzzle of the piece to his ear and shot him into the head again which dispatched him quite this was game indeed to us but this was no food and i was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to us however xury said he would have some of him so he comes on board and asked me to give him the hatchet for what xury said i me cut off his head said he however xury could not cut off his head but he cut off a foot and brought it with him and it was a monstrous great one i bethought myself however that perhaps the skin of him might one way or other be of some value to us and i resolved to take off his skin if i could so xury and i went to work with him but xury was much the better workman at it for i knew very ill how to do it indeed it took us up both the whole day but at last we got off the hide of him and spreading it on the top of our cabin the sun effectually dried it in two days time and it afterwards served me to lie upon after this stop we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days living very sparing on our provisions which began to abate very much and going no oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water my design in this was to make the river gambia or senegal that is to say any where about the cape de verd where i was in hopes to meet with some european ship and if i did not i knew not what course i had to take but to seek for the islands or perish there among the negroes i knew that all the ships from europe which sailed either to the coast of guinea or brasil or to the east indies made this cape or those islands and in a word i put the whole of my fortune upon this single point either that i must meet with some ship or must perish when i had passed this resolution about ten days longer as i have said i began to see that the land was inhabited and in two or three places as we sailed by we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us we could also perceive that they were quite black and stark naked i was once inclined to have gone on shore to them but xury was my better counsellor and said to me no go no go however i hauled in nearer the shore that i might talk to them and i found they run along the shore by me a good way i observed they had no weapons in their hands except one who had a long slender stick which xury said was a lance and that they would throw them a great way with good aim so i kept at a distance but talked with them by signs as well as i could and particularly made signs for something to eat they beckoned to me to stop my boat and they would fetch me some meat upon this i lowered the top of my sail and lay by and two of them ran up into the country and in less than half an hour came back and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh and some corn such as is the produce of their country but we neither knew what the one nor the other was however we were willing to accept it but how to come at it was our next dispute for i was not for venturing on shore to them and they were as much afraid of us but they took a safe way for us all for they brought it to the shore and laid it down and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board and then came close to us again we made signs of thanks to them for we had nothing to make them amends but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures one pursuing the other as we took it with great fury from the mountains towards the sea whether it was the male pursuing the female or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not tell any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange but i believe it was the latter because in the first place those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night and in the second place we found the people terribly frighted especially the women the man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them but the rest did however as the two creatures ran directly into the water they did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the negroes but plunged themselves into the sea and swam about as if they had come for their diversion at last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first i expected but i lay ready for him for i had loaded my gun with all possible expedition and had xury load both the others as soon as he came fairly within my reach i fired and shot him directly into the head immediately he sunk down into the water but rose instantly and plunged up and down as if he was struggling for life and so indeed he was he immediately made to the shore but between the wound which was his mortal hurt and the strangling of the water he died just before he reached the shore it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun some of them were even ready to die for fear and fell down as dead with the very terror but when they saw the creature dead and sunk in the water and that i made signs to them to come to the shore they took heart and came to the shore and began to search for the creature i found him by his blood staining the water and by the help of a rope which i slung round him and gave the negroes to hale they dragged him on shore and found that it was a most curious leopard spotted and fine to an admirable degree and the negroes held up their hands with admiration to think what it was i had killed him with the other creature frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun swam on shore and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they came nor could i at that distance know what it was i found quickly the negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature so i was willing to have them take it as a favour from me which when i made signs to them that they might take him they were very thankful for immediately they fell to work with him and though they had no knife yet with a sharpened piece of wood they took off his skin as readily and much more readily than we could have done with a knife they offered me some of the flesh which i declined making as if i would give it them but made signs for the skin which they gave me very freely and brought me a great deal more of their provision which though i did not understand yet i accepted then i made signs to them for some water and held out one of my jars to them turning it bottom upward to shew that it was empty and that i wanted to have it filled they called immediately to some of their friends and there came two women and brought a great vessel made of earth and burnt as i suppose in the sun this they set down for me as before and i sent xury on shore with my jars and filled them all three the women were as stark naked as the men i was now furnished with roots and corn such as it was and water and leaving my friendly negroes i made forward for about eleven days more without offering to go near the shore till i saw the land run out a great length into the sea at about the distance of four or five leagues before me and the sea being very calm i kept a large offing to make this point at length doubling the point at about two leagues from the land i saw plainly land on the other side to seaward then i concluded as it was most certain indeed that this was the cape de verd and those the islands called from thence cape de verd islands however they were at a great distance and i could not well tell what i had best to do for if i should be taken with a fresh of wind i might neither reach one nor the other in this dilemma as i was very pensive i stepped into the cabin and sat me down xury having the helm when on a sudden the boy cried out master master a ship with a sail and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits thinking it must needs be some of his master s ships sent to pursue us when i knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach i jumped out of the cabin and immediately saw not only the ship but what she was viz that it was a portuguese ship and as i thought was bound to the coast of guinea for negroes but when i observed the course she steered i was soon convinced they were bound some other way and did not design to come any nearer to the shore upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could resolving to speak with them if possible with all the sail i could muster i found i should not be able to come in their way but that they would be gone by before i could make any signal to them but after i had crowded to the utmost and began to despair they it seems saw me by the help of their perspective glasses and that it was some european boat which as they supposed must belong to some ship that was lost so they shortened sail to let me come up i was encouraged with this and as i had my patron s ancient on board i made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress and fired a gun both which they saw for they told me they saw the smoke though they did not hear the gun upon these signals they very kindly brought to and lay by for me and in about three hours time i came up with them they asked me what i was in portuguese and in spanish and in french but i understood none of them but at last a scots sailor who was on board called to me and i answered him and told him i was an englishman that i had made my escape out of slavery from the moors at sallee then they had me come on board and very kindly took me in and all my goods it was an inexpressible joy to me that any one would believe that i was thus delivered as i esteemed it from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition as i was in and immediately offered all i had to the captain of the ship as a return for my deliverance but he generously told me he would take nothing from me but that all i had should be delivered safe to me when i came to the brasils for says he i have saved your life on no other terms than i would be glad to be saved myself and it may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in the same condition besides said he when i carry you to the brasils so great a way from your own country if i should take from you what you have you will be starved there and then i only take away that life i have given no no seignor inglese says he mr englishman i will carry you thither in charity and those things will help you to buy your subsistence there and your passage home again as he was charitable in his proposal so he was just in the performance to a tittle for he ordered the seamen that none should offer to touch any thing i had then he took every thing into his own possession and gave me back an exact inventory of them that i might have them even so much as my three earthen jars as to my boat it was a very good one and that he saw and told me he would buy it of me for the ship s use and asked me what i would have for it i told him he had been so generous to me in everything that i could not offer to make any price of the boat but left it entirely to him upon which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at brasil and when it came there if any one offered to give more he would make it up he offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy xury which i was loath to lake not that i was not willing to let the captain have him but i was very loath to sell the poor boy s liberty who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own however when i let him know my reason he owned it to be just and offered me this medium that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years if he turned christian upon this and xury saying he was willing to go to him i let the captain have him we had a very good voyage to the brasils and arrived in the bay de todos los santos or all saints bay in about twenty two days after and now i was once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life and what to do next with myself i was now to consider the generous treatment the captain gave me i can never enough remember he would take nothing of me for my passage gave me twenty ducats for the leopard s skin and forty for the lion s skin which i had in my boat and caused every thing i had in the ship to be punctually delivered me and what i was willing to sell he bought such as the case of bottles two of my guns and a piece of the lump of bees wax for i had made candles of the rest in a word i made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo and with this stock i went on shore in the brasils i had not been long here but being recommended to the house of a good honest man like himself who had an ingeino as they call it that is a plantation and a sugarhouse i lived with him some time and acquainted myself by that means with the manner of their planting and making of sugar and seeing how well the planters lived and how they grew rich suddenly i resolved if i could get license to settle there i would turn planter among them resolving in the mean time to find out some way to get my money which i had left in london remitted to me to this purpose getting a kind of a letter of naturalization i purchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement and such a one as might be suitable to the stock which i proposed to myself to receive from england i had a neighbour a portuguese of lisbon but born of english parents whose name was wells and in much such circumstances as i was i call him neighbour because his plantation lay next to mine and we went on very sociable together my stock was but low as well as his and we rather planted for food than any thing else for about two years however we began to increase and our land began to come into order so that the third year we planted some tobacco and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come but we both wanted help and now i found more than before i had done wrong in parting with my boy xury but alas for me to do wrong that never did right was no great wonder i had no remedy but to go on i was gotten into an employment quite remote to my genius and directly contrary to the life i delighted in and for which i forsook my father s house and broke through all his good advice nay i was coming into the very middle station or upper degree of low life which my father advised me to before and which if i resolved to go on with i might as well have staid at home and never have fatigued myself in the world as i had done and i used often to say to myself i could have done this as well in england among my friends as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages in a wilderness and at such distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me in this manner i used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret i had nobody to converse with but now and then this neighbour no work to be done but by the labour of my hands and i used to say i lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island that had nobody there but himself but how just has it been and how should all men reflect that when they compare their present conditions with others that are worse heaven may oblige them to make the exchange and be convinced of their former felicity by their experience i say how just has it been that the truly solitary life i reflected on in an island of mere desolation should be my lot who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which i then led in which had i continued i had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend the captain of the ship that took me up at sea went back for the ship remained there in providing his loading and preparing for his voyage near three months when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london he gave me this friendly and sincere advice seignor inglese says he for so he always called me if you will give me letters and a procuration here in form to me with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon to such persons as i shall direct and in such goods as are proper for this country i will bring you the produce of them god willing at my return but since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling which you say is half your stock and let the hazard be run for the first so that if it come safe you may order the rest the same way and if it miscarry you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply this was so wholesome advice and looked so friendly that i could not but be convinced it was the best course i could take so i accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom i had left my money and a procuration to the portuguese captain as he desired i wrote the english captain s widow a full account of all my adventures my slavery escape and how i had met with the portugal captain at sea the humanity of his behaviour and what condition i was now in with all other necessary directions for my supply and when this honest captain came to lisbon he found means by some of the english merchants there to send over not the order only but a full account of my story to a merchant at london who represented it effectually to her whereupon she not only delivered the money but out of her own pocket sent the portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity and charity to me the merchant in london vesting this hundred pounds in english goods such as the captain had writ for sent them directly to him at lisbon and he brought them all safe to me to the brasils among which without my direction for i was too young in my business to think of them he had taken care to have all sort of tools iron work and utensils necessary for my plantation and which were of great use to me when this cargo arrived i thought my fortune made for i was surprised with joy of it and my good steward the captain had laid out the five pounds which my friend had sent him for a present for himself to purchase and bring me over a servant under bond for six years service and would not accept of any consideration except a little tobacco which i would have him accept being of my own produce neither was this all but my goods being all english manufactures such as cloth stuffs baize and things particularly valuable and desirable in the country i found means to sell them to a very great advantage so that i may say i had more than four times the value of my first cargo and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour i mean in the advancement of my plantation for the first thing i did i bought me a negro slave and an european servant also i mean another besides that which the captain brought me from lisbon but as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our greatest adversity so was it with me i went on the next year with great success in my plantation i raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground more than i had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours and these fifty rolls being each of above a hundred weight were well cured and laid by against the return of the fleet from lisbon and now increasing in business and in wealth my head began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach such as are indeed often the ruin of the best heads in business had i continued in the station i was now in i had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life and of which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full but other things attended me and i was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries and particularly to increase my fault and double the reflections upon myself which in my future sorrows i should have leisure to make all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad and pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects and those measures of life which nature and providence concurred to present me with and to make my duty as i had done thus in my breaking away from my parents so i could not be content now but i must go and leave the happy view i had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted and thus i cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the world to come then by just degrees to the particulars of this part of my story you may suppose that having now lived almost four years in the brasils and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation i had not only learnt the language but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow planters as well as among the merchants at st salvadore which was our port and that in my discourse among them i had frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast of guinea the manner of trading with the negroes there and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles such as beads toys knives scissars hatchets bits of glass and the like not only gold dust guinea grains elephants teeth c but negroes for the service of the brasils in great numbers they listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads but especially to that part which related to the buying negroes which was a trade at that time not only not far entered into but as far as it was had been carried on by the assientos for permission of the kings of spain and portugal and engrossed in the public so that few negroes were brought and those excessive dear it happened being in company with some merchants and planters of my acquaintance and talking of those things very earnestly three of them came to me the next morning and told me they had been musing very much upon what i had discoursed with them of the last night and they came to make a secret proposal to me and after enjoining me secrecy they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to to guinea that they had all plantations as well as i and were straitened for nothing so much as servants that as it was a trade could not be carried on because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home so they desired to make but one voyage to bring the negroes on shore privately and divide them among their own plantations and in a word the question was whether i would go their supercargo in the ship to manage the trading part upon the coast of guinea and they offered me that i should have my equal share of the negroes without providing any part of the stock this was a fair proposal it must be confessed had it been made to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of his own to look after which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable and with a good stock upon it but for me that was thus entered and established and had nothing to do but go on as i had begun for three or four years more and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from england and who in that time and with that little addition could scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling and that increasing too for me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of but i that was born to be my own destroyer could no more resist the offer than i could restrain my first rambling designs when my father s good counsel was lost upon me in a word i told them i would go with all my heart if they would undertake to look alter my plantation in my absence and would dispose of it to such as i should direct if i miscarried this they all engaged to do and entered into writings or covenants to do so and i made a formal will disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my death making the captain of the ship that had saved my life as before my universal heir but obliging him to dispose of my effects as i had directed in my will one half of the produce being to himself and the other to be shipped to england in short i took all possible caution to preserve my effects and keep up my plantation had i used half as much prudence to have looked into my own interest and have made a judgment of what i ought to have done and not to have done i had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking leaving all the probable views of a thriving circumstance and gone upon a voyage to sea attended with all its common hazards to say nothing of the reasons i had to expect particular misfortunes to myself but i was hurried on and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather than my reason and accordingly the ship being fitted out and the cargo furnished and all things done as by agreement by my partners in the voyage i went on board in an evil hour the 1st of september 1650 being the same day eight years that i went from my father and mother at hull in order to act the rebel to their authority and the fool to my own interest our ship was about one hundred and twenty ton burden carrying six guns and fourteen men besides the master his boy and myself we had on board no large cargo of goods except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes such as beads bits of glass shells and odd trifles especially little looking glasses knives scissars hatchets and the like the same day i went on board we set sail standing away to the northward upon our own coast with design to stretch over for the african coast when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of northern latitude which it seems was the manner of their course in those days we had very good weather only excessive hot all the way upon our own coast till we made the height of cape st augustino from whence keeping farther off at sea we lost sight of land and steered as if we were bound for the isle fernand de noronha holding our course n e by n and leaving those isles on the east in this course we passed the line in about twelve days time and were by our last observation in 7 degrees 22 min northern latitude when a violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge it began from the south east came about to the north west and then settled into the north east from whence it blew in such a terrible manner that for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive and scudding away before it let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of the winds directed and during these twelve days i need not say that i expected every day to be swallowed up nor indeed did any in the ship expect to save their lives in this distress we had besides the terror of the storm one of our men die of the calenture and one man and the boy washed overboard about the twelfth day the weather abating a little the master made an observation as well as he could and found that he was in about 11 degrees north latitude but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference west from cape st augustino so that he found he was gotten upon the coast of guinea or the north part of brasil beyond the river amazones toward that of the river oronoque commonly called the great river and began to consult with me what course he should take for the ship was leaky and very much disabled and he was going directly back to the coast of brasil i was positively against that and looking over the charts of the sea coasts of america with him we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the caribbee islands and therefore resolved to stand away for barbadoes which by keeping off at sea to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico we might easily perform as we hoped in about fifteen days sail whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves with this design we changed our course and steered away n w by w in order to reach some of our english islands where i hoped for relief but our voyage was otherwise determined for being in the latitude of 12 deg 18 min a second storm came upon us which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward and drove us so out of the very way of all human commerce that had all our lives been saved as to the sea we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country in this distress the wind still blowing very hard one of our men early in the morning cried out land and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were but the ship struck upon a sand and in a moment her motion being so stopped the sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we should all have perished immediately and we were immediately driven into our close quarters to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea it is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances we knew nothing where we were or upon what land it was we were driven whether an island or the main whether inhabited or not inhabited and as the rage of the wind was still great though rather less than at first we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without breaking in pieces unless the winds by a kind of miracle should turn immediately about in a word we sat looking one upon another and expecting death every moment and every man acting accordingly as preparing for another world for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this that which was our present comfort and all the comfort we had was that contrary to our expectation the ship did not break yet and that the master said the wind began to abate now though we thought that the wind did a little abate yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off we were in a dreadful condition indeed and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could we had a boat at our stern just before the storm but she was first staved by dashing against the ship s rudder and in the next place she broke away and either sunk or was driven off to sea so there was no hope from her we had another boat on board but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing however there was no room to debate for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute and some told us she was actually broken already in this distress the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat and with the help of the rest of the men they got her slung over the ship s side and getting all into her let go and committed ourselves being eleven in number to god s mercy and the wild sea for though the storm was abated considerably yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore and might well be called den wild zee as the dutch call the sea in a storm and now our case was very dismal indeed for we all saw plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not live and that we should be inevitably drowned as to making sail we had none nor if we had could we have done any thing with it so we worked at the oar towards the land though with heavy hearts like men going to execution for we all knew that when the boat came nearer the shore she would be dashed into a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea however we committed our souls to god in the most earnest manner and the wind driving us towards the shore we hastened our destruction with our own hands pulling as well as we could towards land what the shore was whether rock or sand whether steep or shoal we knew not the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expectation was if we might happen into some bay or gulf or the mouth of some river where by great chance we might have run our boat in or got under the lee of the land and perhaps made smooth water but there was nothing of this appeared but as we made nearer and nearer the shore the land looked more frightful than the sea after we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a half as we reckoned it a raging wave mountain like came rolling astern of us and plainly had us expect the coup de grace in a word it took us with such a fury that it overset the boat at once and separating us as well from the boat as from one another gave us not time hardly to say o god for we were all swallowed up in a moment nothing can describe the confusion of thought which i felt when i sunk into the water for though i swam very well yet i could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath till that wave having driven me or rather carried me a vast way on towards the shore and having spent itself went back and left me upon the land almost dry but half dead with the water i took in i had so much presence of mind as well as breath left that seeing myself nearer the main land than i expected i got upon my feet and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as i could before another wave should return and take me up again but i soon found it was impossible to avoid it for i saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill and as furious as an enemy which i had no means or strength to contend with my business was to hold my breath and raise myself upon the water if i could and so by swimming to preserve my breathing and pilot myself towards the shore if possible my greatest concern now being that the sea as it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea the wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty foot deep in its own body and i could feel myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way but i held my breath and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might i was ready to burst with holding my breath when as i felt myself rising up so to my immediate relief i found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water and though it was not two seconds of time that i could keep myself so yet it relieved me greatly gave me breath and new courage i was covered again with water a good while but not so long but i held it out and finding the water had spent itself and began to return i struck forward against the return of the waves and felt ground again with my feet i stood still a few moments to recover breath and till the water went from me and then took to my heels and ran with what strength i had farther towards the shore but neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea which came pouring in after me again and twice more i was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before the shore being very flat the last time of these two had well near been fatal to me for the sea having hurried me along as before landed me or rather dashed me against a piece of a rock and that with such force as it left me senseless and indeed helpless as to my own deliverance for the blow taking my side and breast beat the breath as it were quite out of my body and had it returned again immediately i must have been strangled in the water but i recovered a little before the return of the waves and seeing i should be covered again with the water i resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock and so to hold my breath if possible till the wave went back now as the waves were not so high as at first being near land i held my hold till the wave abated and then fetched another run which brought me so near the shore that the next wave though it went over me yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away and the next run i took i got to the main land where to my great comfort i clambered up the clifts of the shore and sat me down upon the grass free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water i was now landed and safe on shore and began to look up and thank god that my life was saved in a case wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope i believe it is impossible to express to the life what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are when it is so saved as i may say out of the very grave and i do not wonder now at that custom viz that when a malefactor who has the halter about his neck is tied up and just going to be turned off and has a reprieve brought to him i say i do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him for sudden joys like griefs confound at first i walked about on the shore lifting up my hands and my whole being as i may say wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance making a thousand gestures and motions which i cannot describe reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned and that there should not be one soul saved but myself for as for them i never saw them afterwards or any sign of them except three of their hats one cap and two shoes that were not fellows i cast my eyes to the stranded vessel when the breach and troth of the sea being so big i could hardly see it it lay so far off and considered lord how was it possible i could get on shore after i had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition i began to look round me to see what kind of place i was in and what was next to be done and i soon found my comforts abate and that in a word i had a dreadful deliverance for i was wet had no clothes to shift me nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me neither did i see any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts and that which was particularly afflicting to me was that i had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs in a word i had nothing about me but a knife a tobacco pipe and a little tobacco in a box this was all my provision and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind that for a while i ran about like a madman night coming upon me i began with a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country seeing at night they always come abroad for their prey all the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir but thorny which grew near me and where i resolved to sit all night and consider the next day what death i should die for as yet i saw no prospect of life i walked about a furlong from the shore to see if i could find any fresh water to drink which i did to my great joy and having drank and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger i went to the tree and getting up into it endeavoured to place myself so as that if i should sleep i might not fall and having cut me a short stick like a truncheon for my defence i took up my lodging and having been excessively fatigued i fell fast asleep and slept as comfortably as i believe few could have done in my condition and found myself the most refreshed with it that i think i ever was on such an occasion when i waked it was broad day the weather clear and the storm abated so that the sea did not rage and swell as before but that which surprised me most was that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide and was driven up almost as far as the rock which i first mentioned where i had been so bruised by the dashing me against it this being within about a mile from the shore where i was and the ship seeming to stand upright still i wished myself on board that at least i might save some necessary things for my use when i came down from my apartment in the tree i looked about me again and the first thing i found was the boat which lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her up upon the land about two miles on my right hand i walked as far as i could upon the shore to have got to her but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a mile broad so i came back for the present being more intent upon getting at the ship where i hoped to find something for my present subsistence a little after noon i found the sea very calm and the tide ebbed so far out that i could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship and here i found a fresh renewing of my grief for i saw evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all safe that is to say we had all got safe on shore and i had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company as i now was this forced tears from my eyes again but as there was little relief in that i resolved if possible to get to the ship so i pulled off my clothes for the weather was hot to extremity and took the water but when i came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board for as she lay aground and high out of the water there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of i swam round her twice and the second time i spied a small piece of a rope which i wondered i did not see at first hang down by the fore chains so low as that with great difficulty i got hold of it and by the help of that rope got up into the forecastle of the ship here i found that the ship was bulged and had a great deal of water in her hold but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand or rather earth and her stern lay lifted up upon the bank and her head low almost to the water by this means all her quarter was free and all that was in that part was dry for you may be sure my first work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what was free and first i found that all the ship s provisions were dry and untouched by the water and being very well disposed to eat i went to the bread room and filled my pockets with bisket and ate it as i went about other things for i had no time to lose i also found some rum in the great cabin of which i took a large drain and which i had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was before me now i wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many things which i foresaw would be very necessary to me it was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had and this extremity roused my application we had several spare yards and two or three large spars of wood and a spare topmast or two in the ship i resolved to fall to work with these and flung as many of them overboard as i could manage of their weight tying every one with a rope that they might not drive away when this was done i went down the ship s side and pulling them to me i tied four of them fast together at both ends as well as i could in the form of a raft and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways i found i could walk upon it very well but that it was not able to bear any great weight the pieces being too light so i went to work and with the carpenter s saw i cut a spare topmast into three lengths and added them to my raft with a great deal of labour and pains but hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what i should have been able to have done upon another occasion my raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight my next care was what to load it with and how to preserve what i laid upon it from the surf of the sea but i was not long considering this i first laid all the planks or boards upon it that i could get and having considered well what i most wanted i first got three of the seamen s chests which i had broken open and emptied and lowered them down upon my raft the first of these i filled with provisions viz bread rice three dutch cheeses five pieces of dried goat s flesh which we lived much upon and a little remainder of european corn which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us but the fowls were killed there had been some barley and wheat together but to my great disappointment i found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all as for liquors i found several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper in which were some cordial waters and in all above five or six gallons of rack these i stowed by themselves there being no need to put them into the chest nor no room for them while i was doing this i found the tide began to flow though very calm and i had the mortification to see my coat shirt and waistcoat which i had left on shore upon the sand swim away as for my breeches which were only linen and open kneed i swam on board in them and my stockings however this put me upon rummaging for clothes of which i found enough but took no more than i wanted for present use for i had other things which my eye was more upon as first tools to work with on shore and it was after long searching that i found out the carpenter s chest which was indeed a very useful prize to me and much more valuable than a ship loading of gold would have been at that time i got it down to my raft even whole as it was without losing time to look into it for i knew in general what it contained my next care was for some ammunition and arms there were two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin and two pistols these i secured first with some powder horns and a small bag of shot and two old rusty swords i knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship but knew not where our gunner had stowed them but with much search i found them two of them dry and good the third had taken water those two i got to my raft with the arms and now i thought myself pretty well freighted and began to think how i should get to shore with them having neither sail oar or rudder and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation i had three encouragements 1 a smooth calm sea 2 the tide rising and setting in to the shore 3 what little wind there was blew me towards the land and thus having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat and besides the tools which were in the chest i found two saws an axe and a hammer and with this cargo i put to sea for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo as i imagined so it was there appeared before me a little opening of the land and i found a strong current of the tide set into it so i guided my raft as well as i could to keep in the middle of the stream but here i had like to have suffered a second shipwreck which if i had i think verily would have broke my heart for knowing nothing of the coast my raft run aground at one end of it upon a shoal and not being aground at the other end it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat and so fallen into the water i did my utmost by setting my back against the chests to keep them in their places but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength neither durst i stir from the posture i was in but holding up the chests with all my might stood in that manner near half an hour in which time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level and a little after the water still rising my raft floated again and i thrust her off with the oar i had into the channel and then driving up higher i at length found myself in the mouth of a little river with land on both sides and a strong current or tide running up i looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore for i was not willing to be driven too high up the river hoping in time to see some ship at sea and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as i could at length i spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek to which with great pain and difficulty i guided my raft and at last got so near as that reaching ground with my oar i could thrust her directly in but here i had like to have dipped all my cargo in the sea again for that shore lying pretty steep that is to say sloping there was no place to land but where one end of the float if it run on shore would lie so high and the other sink lower as before that it would endanger my cargo again all that i could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore near a flat piece of ground which i expected the water would flow over and so it did as soon as i found water enough for my raft drew about a foot of water i thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground and there fastened or moored her by sticking my two broken oars into the ground one on one side near one end and one on the other side near the other end and thus i lay till the water ebbed away and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore my next work was to view the country and seek a proper place for my habitation and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever might happen where i was i yet knew not whether on the continent or on an island whether inhabited or not inhabited whether in danger of wild beasts or not there was a hill not above a mile from me which rose up very steep and high and which seemed to overtop some other hills which lay as in a ridge from it northward i took out one of the fowling pieces and one of the pistols and an horn of powder and thus armed i travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill where after i had with great labour and difficulty got to the top i saw my fates to my great affliction viz that i was in an island environed every way with the sea no land to be seen except some rocks which lay a great way off and two small islands less than this which lay about three leagues to the west i found also that the island i was in was barren and as i saw good reason to believe uninhabited except by wild beasts of whom however i saw none yet i saw abundance of fowls but knew not their kinds neither when i killed them could i tell what was fit for food and what not at my coming back i shot at a great bird which i saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood i believe it was the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world i had no sooner fired but from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls of many sorts making a confused screaming and crying every one according to his usual note but not one of them of any kind that i knew as for the creature i killed i took it to be a kind of a hawk its colour and beak resembling it but had no talons or claws more than common its flesh was carrion and fit for nothing contented with this discovery i came back to my raft and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore which took me up the rest of that day and what to do with myself at night i knew not nor indeed where to rest for i was afraid to lie down on the ground not knowing but some wild beast might devour me though as i afterwards found there was really no need for those fears however as well as i could i barricadoed myself round with the chests and boards that i had brought on shore and made a kind of a hut for that night s lodging as for food i yet saw not which way to supply myself except that i had seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the wood where i shot the fowl i now began to consider that i might yet get a great many things out of the ship which would be useful to me and particularly some of the rigging and sails and such other things as might come to land and i resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel if possible and as i knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces i resolved to set all other things apart till i got every thing out of the ship that i could get then i called a council that is to say in my thoughts whether i should take back the raft but this appeared impracticable so i resolved to go as before when the tide was down and i did so only that i stripped before i went from my hut having nothing on but a checked shirt and a pair of linen trowsers and a pair of pumps on my feet i got on board the ship as before and prepared a second raft and having had experience of the first i neither made this so unwieldy nor loaded it so hard but yet i brought away several things very useful to me as first in the carpenter s stores i found two or three bags full of nails and spikes a great screw jack a dozen or two of hatchets and above all that most useful thing called a grindstone all these i secured together with several things belonging to the gunner particularly two or three iron crows and two barrels of musket bullets seven muskets and another fowling piece with some small quantity of powder more a large bag full of small shot and a great roll of sheet lead but this last was so heavy i could not hoist it up to get it over the ship s side besides these things i took all the men s clothes that i could find and a spare fore topsail hammock and some bedding and with this i loaded my second raft and brought them all safe on shore to my very great comfort i was under some apprehensions during my absence from the land that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore but when i came back i found no sign of any visitor only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests which when i came towards it ran away a little distance and then stood still she sat very composed and unconcerned and looked full in my face as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me i presented my gun at her but as she did not understand it she was perfectly unconcerned at it nor did she offer to stir away upon which i tossed her a bit of biscuit though by the way i was not very free of it for my store was not great however i spared her a bit i say and she went to it smelled of it and ate it and looked as pleased for more but i thanked her and could spare no more so she marched off having got my second cargo on shore though i was fain to open the barrels of powder and bring them by parcels for they were too heavy being large casks i went to work to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles which i cut for that purpose and into this tent i brought every thing that i knew would spoil either with rain or sun and i piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from man or beast when i had done this i blocked up the door of the tent with some boards within and an empty chest set up an end without and spreading one of the beds upon the ground laying my two pistols just at my head and my gun at length by me i went to bed for the first time and slept very quietly all night for i was very weary and heavy as the night before i had slept little and had laboured very hard all day as well to fetch all those things from the ship as to get them on shore i had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever were laid up i believe for one man but i was not satisfied still for while the ship sat upright in that posture i thought i ought to get every thing out of her that i could so every day at low water i went on board and brought away something or other but particularly the third time i went i brought away as much of the rigging as i could as also all the small ropes and rope twine i could get with a piece of spare canvass which was to mend the sails upon occasion and the barrel of wet gunpowder in a word i brought away all the sails first and last only that i was fain to cut them in pieces and bring as much at a time as i could for they were no more useful to be sails but as mere canvass only but that which comforted me more still was that at last of all after i had made five or six such voyages as these and thought i had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with i say after all this i found a great hogshead of bread and three large runlets of rum or spirits and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine flower this was surprising to me because i had given over expecting any more provisions except what was spoiled by the water i soon emptied the hogshead of that bread and wrapped it up parcel by parcel in pieces of the sails which i cut out and in a word i got all this safe on shore also the next day i made another voyage and now having plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out i began with the cables and cutting the great cable into pieces such as i could move i got two cables and a hawser on shore with all the iron work i could get and having cut down the spritsail yard and the mizen yard and every thing i could to make a large raft i loaded it with all those heavy goods and came away but my good luck began now to leave me for this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen that after i had entered the little cove where i had landed the rest of my goods not being able to guide it so handily as i did the other it overset and threw me and all my cargo into the water as for myself it was no great harm for i was near the shore but as to my cargo it was great part of it lost especially the iron which i expected would have been of great use to me however when the tide was out i got most of the pieces of cable ashore and some of the iron though with infinite labour for i was fain to dip for it into the water a work which fatigued me very much after this i went every day on board and brought away what i could get i had been now thirteen days on shore and had been eleven times on board the ship in which time i had brought away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring though i believe verily had the calm weather held i should have brought away the whole ship piece by piece but preparing the twelfth time to go on board i found the wind began to rise however at low water i went on board and though i thought i had rummaged the cabin so effectually as that nothing more could be found yet i discovered a locker with drawers in it in one of which i found two or three razors and one pair of large scissars with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks in another i found about thirty six pounds value in money some european coin some brasil some pieces of eight some gold some silver i smiled to myself at the sight of this money o drug said i aloud what art thou good for thou art not worth to me no not the taking off of the ground one of those knives is worth all this heap i have no manner of use for thee even remain where thou art and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is not worth saving however upon second thoughts i took it away and wrapping all this in a piece of canvass i began to think of making another raft but while i was preparing this i found the sky overcast and the wind began to rise and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore it presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood began otherwise i might not be able to reach the shore at all accordingly i let myself down into the water and swam cross the channel which lay between the ship and the sands and even that with difficulty enough partly with the weight of things i had about me and partly the roughness of the water for the wind rose very hastily and before it was quite high water it blew a storm but i was gotten home to my little tent where i lay with all my wealth about me very secure it blew very hard all that night and in the morning when i looked out behold no more ship was to be seen i was a little surprised but recovered myself with this satisfactory reflection viz that i had lost no time nor abated no diligence to get every thing out of her that could be useful to me and that indeed there was little left in her that i was able to bring away if i had had more time i now gave over any more thoughts of the ship or of any thing out of her except what might drive on shore from her wreck as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did but those things were of small use to me my thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either savages if any should appear or wild beasts if any were in the island and i had many thoughts of the method how to do this and what kind of dwelling to make whether i should make me a cave in the earth or a tent upon the earth and in short i resolved upon both the manner and description of which it may not be improper to give an account of i soon found the place i was in was not for my settlement particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near the sea and i believed would not be wholesome and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it so i resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground i consulted several things in my situation which i found would be proper for me 1st health and fresh water i just now mentioned 2dly shelter from the heat of the sun 3dly security from ravenous creatures whether man or beast 4thly a view to the sea that if god sent any ship in sight i might not lose any advantage for my deliverance of which i was not willing to banish all my expectation yet in search of a place proper for this i found a little plain on the side of a rising hill whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house side so that nothing could come down upon me from the top on the side of this rock there was a hollow place worn a little way in like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all on the flat of the green just before this hollow place i resolved to pitch my tent this plain was not above an hundred yards broad and about twice as long and lay like a green before my door and at the end of it descended irregularly every way down into the low grounds by the sea side it was on the n n w side of the hill so that i was sheltered from the heat every day till it came to a w and by s sun or thereabouts which in those countries is near the setting before i set up my tent i drew a half circle before the hollow place which took in about ten yards in its semi diameter from the rock and twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending in this half circle i pitched two rows of strong stakes driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles the biggest end being out of the ground about five foot and a half and sharpened on the top the two rows did not stand above six inches from one another then i took the pieces of cable which i had cut in the ship and laid them in rows one upon another within the circle between these two rows of stakes up to the top placing other stakes in the inside leaning against them about two foot and a half high like a spur to a post and this fence was so strong that neither man or beast could get into it or over it this cost me a great deal of time and labour especially to cut the piles in the woods bring them to the place and drive them into the earth the entrance into this place i made to be not by a door but by a short ladder to go over the top which ladder when i was in i lifted over after me and so i was completely fenced in and fortified as i thought from all the world and consequently slept secure in the night which otherwise i could not have done though as it appeared afterward there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from into this fence or fortress with infinite labour i carried all my riches all my provisions ammunition and stores of which you have the account above and i made me a large tent which to preserve me from the rains that in one part of the year are very violent there i made double viz one smaller tent within and one larger tent above it and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin which i had saved among the sails and now i lay no more for awhile in the bed which i had brought on shore but in a hammock which was indeed a very good one and belonged to the mate of the ship into this tent i brought all my provisions and every thing that would spoil by the wet and having thus enclosed all my goods i made up the entrance which till now i had left open and so passed and repassed as i said by a short ladder when i had done this i began to work my way into the rock and bringing all the earth and stones that i dug down out through my tent i laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace that so it raised the ground within about a foot and a half and thus i made me a cave just behind my tent which served me like a cellar to my house it cost me much labour and many days before all these things were brought to perfection and therefore i must go back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts at the same time it happened after i had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent and making the cave that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud a sudden flash of lightning happened and after that a great clap of thunder as is naturally the effect of it i was not so much surprised with the lightning as i was with a thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning itself o my powder my very heart sunk within me when i thought that at one blast all my powder might be destroyed on which not my defence only but the providing me food as i thought entirely depended i was nothing near so anxious about my own danger though had the powder took fire i had never known who had hurt me such impression did this make upon me that after the storm was over i laid aside all my works my building and fortifying and applied myself to make bags and boxes to separate the powder and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel in hope that whatever might come it might not all take fire at once and to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one part fire another i finished this work in about a fortnight and i think my powder which in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight was divided in not less than a hundred parcels as to the barrel that had been wet i did not apprehend any danger from that so i placed it in my new cave which in my fancy i called my kitchen and the rest i hid up and down in holes among the rocks so that no wet might come to it marking very carefully where i laid it in the interval of time while this was doing i went out once at least every day with my gun as well to divert myself as to see if i could kill any thing fit for food and as near as i could to acquaint myself with what the island produced the first time i went out i presently discovered that there were goats in the island which was a great satisfaction to me but then it was attended with this misfortune to me viz that they were so shy so subtle and so swift of foot that it was the most difficult thing in the world to come at them but i was not discouraged at this not doubting but i might now and then shoot one as it soon happened for after i had found their haunts a little i laid wait in this manner for them i observed if they saw me in the vallies though they were upon the rocks they would run away as in a terrible fright but if they were feeding in the vallies and i was upon the rocks they took no notice of me from whence i concluded that by the position of their optics their sight was so directed downward that they did not readily see objects that were above them so afterward i took this method i always climbed the rocks first to get above them and then had frequently a fair mark the first shot i made among these creatures killed a she goat which had a little kid by her which she gave suck to which grieved me heartily but when the old one fell the kid stood stock still by her till i came and took her up and not only so but when i carried the old one with me upon my shoulders the kid followed me quite to my enclosure upon which i laid down the dam and took the kid in my arms and carried it over my pale in hopes to have bred it up tame but it would not eat so i was forced to kill it and eat it myself these two supplied me with flesh a great while for i ate sparingly and saved my provisions my bread especially as much as possibly i could having now fixed my habitation i found it absolutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in and fuel to burn and what i did for that as also how i enlarged my cave and what conveniencies i made i shall give a full account of in its place but i must first give some little account of myself and of my thoughts about living which it may well be supposed were not a few i had a dismal prospect of my condition for as i was not cast away upon that island without being driven as is said by a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage and a great way viz some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind i had great reason to consider it as a determination of heaven that in this desolate place and in this desolate manner i should end my life the tears would run plentifully down my face when i made these reflections and sometimes i would expostulate with myself why providence should thus completely ruin his creatures and render them so absolutely miserable so without help abandoned so entirely depressed that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life but something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts and to reprove me and particularly one day walking with my gun in my hand by the sea side i was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition when reason as it were expostulating with the t other way thus well you are in a desolate condition tis true but pray remember where are the rest of you did not you come eleven of you into the boat where are the ten why were they not saved and you lost why were you singled out is it better to be here or there and then i pointed to the sea all evils are to be considered with the good that is in them and with what worse attended them then it occurred to me again how well i was furnished for my subsistence and what would have been my ease if it had not happened which was an hundred thousand to one that the ship floated from the place where she first struck and was driven so near the shore that i had time to get all these things out of her what would have been my case if i had been to have lived in the condition in which i at first came on shore without necessaries of life or necessaries to supply and procure them particularly said i loud though to myself what should i have done without a gun without ammunition without any tools to make any thing or to work with without clothes bedding a tent or any manner of covering and that now i had all these to a sufficient quantity and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent so that i had a tolerable view of subsisting without any want as long as i lived for i considered from the beginning how i should provide for the accidents that might happen and for the time that was to come even not only after my ammunition should be spent but even after my health or strength should decay i confess i had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being destroyed at one blast i mean my powder being blown up by lightning and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it lightned and thundered as i observed just now and now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent life such perhaps as was never heard of in the world before i shall take it from its beginning and continue it in its order it was by my account the 30th of september when in the manner as above said i first set foot upon this horrid island when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox was almost just over my head for i reckoned myself by observation to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of the line after i had been there about ten or twelve days it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books and pen and ink and should even forget the sabbath days from the working days but to prevent this i cut it with my knife upon a large post in capital letters and making it into a great cross i set it up on the shore where i first landed viz i came on shore here on the 30th of september 1659 upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest and every first day of the month as long again as that long one and thus i kept my calendar or weekly monthly and yearly reckoning of time in the next place we are to observe that among the many things which i brought out of the ship in the several voyages which as above mentioned i made to it i got several things of less value but not all less useful to me which i omitted setting down before as in particular pens ink and paper several parcels in the captain s mate s gunner s and carpenter s keeping three or four compasses some mathematical instruments dials perspectives charts and books of navigation all which i huddled together whether i might want them or no also i found three very good bibles which came to me in my cargo from england and which i had packed up among my things some portuguese books also and among them two or three popish prayer books and several other books all which i carefully secured and i must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats of whose eminent history i may have occasion to say something in it s place for i carried both the cats with me and as for the dog he jumped out of the ship of himself and swam on shore to me the day after i went on shore with my first cargo and was a trusty servant to me many years i wanted nothing that he could fetch me nor any company that he could make up to me i only wanted to have him talk to me but that he could not do as i observed before i found pen ink and paper and i husbanded them to the utmost and i shall shew that while my ink lasted i kept things very exact but after that was gone i could not for i could not make any ink by any means that i could devise and this put me in mind that i wanted many things notwithstanding all that i had amassed together and of these this of ink was one as also spade pickaxe and shovel to dig or remove the earth needles pins and thread as for linen i soon learnt to want that without much difficulty this want of tools made every work i did go on heavily and it was near a whole year before i had entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habitation the piles or stakes which were as heavy as i could well lift were a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods and more by far in bringing home so that i spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts and a third day in driving it into the ground for which purpose i got a heavy piece of wood at first but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows which however though i found it yet it made driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work but what need i have been concerned at the tediousness of any thing i had to do seeing i had time enough to do it in nor had i any other employment if that had been over at least that i could foresee except the ranging the island to seek for food which i did more or less every day i now began to consider seriously my condition and the circumstance i was reduced to and i drew up the state of my affairs in writing not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me for i was like to have but few heirs as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them and afflicting my mind and as my reason began now to master my despondency i began to comfort myself as well as i could and to set the good against the evil that i might have something to distinguish my case from worse and i stated it very impartially like debtor and creditor the comforts i enjoyed against the miseries i suffered thus evil good i am cast upon a horrible but i am alive and desolate island void not drowned as all my of all hope of recovery ship s company was i am singled out and but i am singled out separated as it were too from all the ship s from all the world to be crew to be spared from miserable death and he that miraculously saved me from death can deliver me from this condition i am divided from but i am not starved mankind a solitaire one and perishing on a barren banished from human society place affording no sustenance i have not clothes to but i am in a hot climate cover me where if i had clothes i could hardly wear them i am without any defence but i am cast on an or means to resist island where i see no any violence of man or wild beasts to hurt me beast as i saw on the coast of africa and what if i had been shipwrecked there i have no soul to speak but god wonderfully to or relieve me sent the ship in near enough to the shore that i have gotten out so many necessary things as will either supply my wants or enable me to supply myself even as long as i live upon the whole here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there was something negative or something positive to be thankful for in it and let this stand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from and to set in the description of good and evil on the credit side of the account having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition and given over looking out to sea to see if i could spy a ship i say giving over these things i began to apply myself to accommodate my way of living and to make things as easy to me as i could i have already described my habitation which was a tent under the side of a rock surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables but i might now rather call it a wall for i raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs about two foot thick on the outside and after some time i think it was a year and half i raised rafters from it leaning to the rock and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees and such things as i could get to keep out the rain which i found at some times of the year very violent i have already observed how i brought all my goods into this pale and into the cave which i had made behind me but i must observe too that at first this was a confused heap of goods which as they lay in no order so they took up all my place i had no room to turn myself so i set myself to enlarge my cave and work farther into the earth for it was a loose sandy rock which yielded easily to the labour i bestowed on it and so when i found i was pretty safe as to beasts of prey i worked sideways to the right hand into the rock and then turning to the right again worked quite out and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification this gave me not only egress and regress as it were a back way to my tent and to my storehouse but gave me room to stow my goods and now i began to apply myself to make such necessary things as i found i most wanted particularly a chair and a table for without these i was not able to enjoy the few comforts i had in the world i could not write or eat or do several things with so much pleasure without a table so i went to work and here i must needs observe that as reason is the substance and original of the mathematics so by stating and squaring every thing by reason and by making the most rational judgment of things every man may be in time master of every mechanic art i had never handled a tool in my life and yet in time by labour application and contrivance i found at last that i wanted nothing but i could have made it especially if i had had tools however i made abundance of things even without tools and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet which perhaps were never made that way before and that with infinite labour for example if i wanted a board i had no other way but to cut down a tree set it on an edge before me and hew it flat on either side with my axe till i had brought it to be as thin as a plank and then dub it smooth with my adze it is true by this method i could make but one board out of a whole tree but this i had no remedy for but patience any more than i had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board but my time or labour was little worth and so it was as well employed one way as another however i made me a table and a chair as i observed above in the first place and this i did out of the short pieces of boards that i brought on my raft from the ship but when i had wrought out some boards as above i made large shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half one over another all along one side of my cave to lay all my tools nails and iron work and in a word to separate every thing at large in their places that i might come easily at them i knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that would hang up so that had my cave been to be seen it looked like a general magazine of all necessary things and i had every thing so ready at my hand that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great and now it was that i began to keep a journal of every day s employment for indeed at first i was in too much a hurry and not only hurry as to labour but in too much discomposure of mind and my journal would have been full of many dull things for example i must have said thus sept the 30th after i got to shore and had escaped drowning instead of being thankful to god for my deliverance having first vomited with the great quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach and recovering myself a little i ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating my head and face exclaiming at my misery and crying out i was undone undone till tired and faint i was forced to lie down on the ground to repose but durst not sleep for fear of being devoured some days after this and after i had been on board the ship and got all that i could out of her yet i could not forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain and looking out to sea in hopes of seeing a ship then fancy at a vast distance i spied a sail please myself with the hopes of it and then after looking steadily till i was almost blind lose it quite and sit down and weep like a child and thus increase my misery by my folly but having gotten over these things in some measure and having settled my household stuff and habitation made me a table and a chair and all as handsome about me as i could i began to keep my journal of which i shall here give you the copy though in it will be told all those particulars over again as long as it lasted for having no more ink i was forced to leave it off the journal september 30 1659 i poor miserable robinson crusoe being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island which i called the island of despair all the rest of the ship s company being drowned and myself almost dead all the rest of that day i spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circumstances i was brought to viz i had neither food house clothes weapon or place to fly to and in despair of any relief saw nothing but death before me either that i should be devoured by wild beasts murdered by savages or starved to death for want of food at the approach of night i slept in a tree for fear of wild creatures but slept soundly though it rained all night october 1 in the morning i saw to my great surprise the ship had floated with the high tide and was driven on shore again much nearer the island which as it was some comfort on one hand for seeing her sit upright and not broken to pieces i hoped if the wind abated i might get on board and get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief so on the other hand it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades who i imagined if we had all staid on board might have saved the ship or at least that they would not have been all drowned as they were and that had the men been saved we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carried us to some other part of the world i spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things but at length seeing the ship almost dry i went upon the sand as near as i could and then swam on board this day also it continued raining though with no wind at all from the 1st of october to the 24th all these days entirely spent in many several voyages to get all i could out of the ship which i brought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts much rain also in these days though with some intervals of fair weather but it seems this was the rainy season oct 20 i overset my raft and all the goods i had got up upon it but being in shoal water and the things being chiefly heavy i recovered many of them when the tide was out oct 25 it rained all night and all day with some gusts of wind during which time the ship broke in pieces the wind blowing a little harder than before and was no more to be seen except the wreck of her and that only at low water i spent this day in covering and securing the goods which i had saved that rain might not spoil them oct 26 i walked about the shore almost all day to find out a place to fix my habitation greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in the night either from wild beasts or men towards night i fixed upon a proper place under a rock and marked out a semicircle for my encampment which i resolved to strengthen with a work wall or fortification made of double piles lined within with cable and without with turf from the 26th to the 30th i worked very hard in carrying all my goods to my new habitation though some part of the time it rained exceeding hard the 31st in the morning i went out into the island with my gun to see for some food and discover the country when i killed a she goat and her kid followed me home which i afterwards killed also because it would not feed november 1 i set up my tent under a rock and lay there for the first night making it as large as i could with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon nov 2 i set up all my chests and boards and the pieces of timber which made my rafts and with them formed a fence round me a little within the place i had marked out for my fortification nov 3 i went out with my gun and killed two fowls like ducks which were very good food in the afternoon went to work to make me a table nov 4 this morning i began to order my times of work of going out with my gun time of sleep and time of diversion viz every morning i walked out with my gun for two or three hours if it did not rain then employed myself to work till about eleven o clock then ate what i had to live on and from twelve to two i lay down to sleep the weather being excessive hot and then in the evening to work again the working part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making my table for i was yet but a very sorry workman though time and necessity make me a complete natural mechanic soon after as i believe it would do any one else nov 5 this day went abroad with my gun and my dog and killed a wild cat her skin pretty soft but her flesh good for nothing every creature i killed i took off the skins and preserved them coming back by the sea shore i saw many sorts of sea fowls which i did not understand but was surprised and almost frighted with two or three seals which while i was gazing at not well knowing what they were got into the sea and escaped me for that time nov 6 after my morning walk i went to work with my table again and finished it though not to my liking nor was it long before i learnt to mend it nov 7 now it began to be settled fair weather the 7th 8th 9th 10th and part of the 12th for the 11th was sunday i took wholly up to make me a chair and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape but never to please me and even in the making i pulled it in pieces several times note i soon neglected my keeping sundays for omitting my mark for them on my post i forgot which was which nov 13 this day it rained which refreshed me exceedingly and cooled the earth but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder as soon as it was over i resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible that it might not be in danger nov 14 15 16 these three days i spent in making little square chests or boxes which might hold a pound or two pound at most of powder and so putting the powder in i stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another as possible on one of these three days i killed a large bird that was good to eat but i knew not what to call it nov 17 this day i began to dig behind my tent into the rock to make room for my farther conveniency note three things i wanted exceedingly for this work viz a pickaxe a shovel and a wheel barrow or basket so i desisted from my work and began to consider how to supply that want and make me some tools as for a pickaxe i made use of the iron crows which were proper enough though heavy but the next thing was a shovel or spade this was so absolutely necessary that indeed i could do nothing effectually without it but what kind of one to make i knew not nov 18 the next day in searching the woods i found a tree of that wood or like it which in the brasils they call the iron tree for its exceeding hardness of this with great labour and almost spoiling my axe i cut a piece and brought it home too with difficulty enough for it was exceeding heavy the excessive hardness of the wood and having no other way made me a long while upon this machine for i worked it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade the handle exactly shaped like ours in england only that the broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom it would not last me so long however it served well enough for the uses which i had occasion to put it to but never was a shovel i believe made after that fashion or so long a making i was still deficient for i wanted a basket or a wheel barrow a basket i could not make by any means having no such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker ware at least none yet found out and as to a wheel barrow i fancied i could make all but the wheel but that i had no notion of neither did i know how to go about it besides i had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in so i gave it over and so for carrying away the earth which i dug out of the cave i made me a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers this was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel and yet this and the shovel and the attempt which i made in vain to make a wheel barrow took me up no less than four days i mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun which i seldom failed and very seldom failed also bringing home something to eat nov 23 my other work having now stood still because of my making these tools when they were finished i went on and working every day as my strength and time allowed i spent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my cave that it might hold my goods commodiously note during all this time i worked to make this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine a kitchen a dining room and a cellar as for my lodging i kept to the tent except that sometimes in the wet season of the year it rained so hard that i could not keep myself dry which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters leaning against the rock and load them with flags and large leaves of trees like a thatch dec 10 i began now to think my cave or vault finished when on a sudden it seems i had made it too large a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side so much that in short it frighted me and not without reason too for if i had been under it i had never wanted a gravedigger upon this disaster i had a great deal of work to do over again for i had the loose earth to carry out and which was of more importance i had the ceiling to prop up so that i might be sure no more would come down dec 11 this day i went to work with it accordingly and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top with two pieces of boards across over each post this i finished the next day and setting more posts up with boards in about a week more i had the roof secured and the posts standing in rows served me for partitions to part off my house dec 17 from this day to the twentieth i placed shelves and knocked up nails on the posts to hang every thing up that could be hung up and now i began to be in some order within doors dec 20 now i carried every thing into the cave and began to furnish my house and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser to order my victuals upon but boards began to be very scarce with me also i made me another table dec 24 much rain all night and all day no stirring out dec 25 rain all day dec 26 no rain and the earth much cooler than before and pleasanter dec 27 killed a young goat and lamed another so that i caught it and led it home in a string when i had it home i bound and splintered up its leg which was broke n b i took such care of it that it lived and the leg grew well and as strong as ever but by nursing it so long it grew tame and fed upon the little green at my door and would not go away this was the first time that i entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures that i might have food when my powder and shot was all spent dec 28 29 30 great heats and no breeze so that there was no stirring abroad except in the evening for food this time i spent in putting all my things in order within doors january 1 very hot still but i went abroad early and late with my gun and lay still in the middle of the day this evening going farther into the vallies which lay towards the centre of the island i found there was plenty of goats though exceeding shy and hard to come at however i resolved to try if i could not bring my dog to hunt them down jan 2 accordingly the next day i went out with my dog and set him upon the goats but i was mistaken for they all faced about upon the dog and he knew his danger too well for he would not come near them jan 3 i began my fence or wall which being still jealous of my being attacked by somebody i resolved to make very thick and strong n b this wall being described before i purposely omit what was said in the journal it is sufficient to observe that i was no less time than from the 3d of january to the 14th of april working finishing and perfecting this wall though it was no more than about twenty four yards in length being a half circle from one place in the rock to another place about eight yards from it the door of the cave being in the centre behind it all this time i worked very hard the rains hindering me many days nay sometimes weeks together but i thought i should never be perfectly secure until this wall was finished and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour every thing was done with especially the bringing piles out of the woods and driving them into the ground for i made them much bigger than i need to have done when this wall was finished and the outside double fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it i persuaded myself that if any people were to come on shore there they would not perceive any thing like a habitation and it was very well i did so as may be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion during this time i made my rounds in the woods for game every day when the rain admitted me and made frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage particularly i found a kind of wild pigeons who built not as wood pigeons in a tree but rather as house pigeons in the holes of the rocks and taking some young ones i endeavoured to breed them up tame and did so but when they grew older they flew away which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them for i had nothing to give them however i frequently found their nests and got their young ones which were very good meat and now in the managing my household affairs i found myself wanting in many things which i thought at first it was impossible for me to make as indeed as to some of them it was for instance i could never make a cask to be hooped i had a small runlet or two as i observed before but i could never arrive to the capacity of making one by them though i spent many weeks about it i could neither put in the heads or joint the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water so i gave that also over in the next place i was at a great loss for candle so that as soon as ever it was dark which was generally by seven o clock i was obliged to go to bed i remembered the lump of bees wax with which i made candles in my african adventure but i had none of that now the only remedy i had was that when i had killed a goat i saved the tallow and with a little dish made of clay which i baked in the sun to which i added a wick of some oakum i made me a lamp and this gave me light though not a clear steady light like a candle in the middle of all my labours it happened that rummaging my things i found a little bag which as i hinted before had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry not for this voyage but before as i suppose when the ship came from lisbon what little remainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured with the rats and i saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust and being willing to have the bag for some other use i think it was to put powder in when i divided it for fear of the lightning or some such use i shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification under the rock it was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that i threw this stuff away taking no notice of any thing and not so much as remembering that i had thrown any thing there when about a month after or thereabout i saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground which i fancied might be some plant i had not seen but i was surprised and perfectly astonished when after a little longer time i saw about ten or twelve ears come out which were perfect green barley of the same kind as our european nay as our english barley it is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts on this occasion i had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all indeed i had very few notions of religion in my head or had entertained any sense of any thing that had befallen me otherwise than as a chance or as we lightly say what pleases god without so much as inquiring into the end of providence in these things or his order in governing events in the world but after i saw barley grow there in a climate which i knew was not proper for corn and especially that i knew not how it came there it startled me strangely and i began to suggest that god had miraculously caused this grain to grow without any help of seed sown and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild miserable place this touched my heart a little and brought tears out of my eyes and i began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account and this was the more strange to me because i saw near it still all along by the side of the rock some other straggling stalks which proved to be stalks of rice and which i knew because i had seen it grow in africa when i was ashore there i not only thought these the pure productions of providence for my support but not doubting but that there was more in the place i went all over that part of the island where i had been before peeping in every corner and under every rock to see for more of it but i could not find any at last it occurred to my thought that i had shook a bag of chicken s meat out in that place and then the wonder began to cease and i must confess my religious thankfulness to god s providence began to abate too upon discovering that all this was nothing but what was common though i ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous for it was really the work of providence as to me that should order or appoint ten or twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled when the rats had destroyed all the rest as if it had been dropped from heaven as also that i should throw it out in that particular place where it being in the shade of a high rock it sprang up immediately whereas if i had thrown it any were else at that time it had been burnt up and destroyed i carefully saved the ears of corn you may be sure in their season which was about the end of june and laying up every corn i resolved to sow them all again hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread but it was not till the fourth year that i could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat and even then but sparingly as i shall say afterwards in its order for i lost all that i sowed the first season by not observing the proper time for i sowed it just before the dry season so that it never came up at all at least not as it would have done of which in its place besides this barley there were as above twenty or thirty stalks of rice which i preserved with the same care and whose use was of the same kind or to the same purpose viz to make me bread or rather food for i found ways to cook it up without baking though i did that also after some time but to return to my journal i worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done and the 14th of april i closed it up contriving to go into it not by a door but over the wall by a ladder that there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation april 16 i finished the ladder so i went up with the ladder to the top and then pulled it up after me and let it down on the inside this was a complete enclosure to me for within i had room enough and nothing could come at me from without unless it could first mount my wall the very next day after this wall was finished i had almost had all my labour overthrown at once and myself killed the case was thus as i was busy in the inside of it behind my tent just in the entrance into my cave i was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed for on a sudden i found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave and from the edge of the hill over my head and two of the posts i had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner i was heartily scared but thought nothing of what was really the cause only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in as some of it had done before and for fear i should be buried in it i ran forward to my ladder and not thinking myself safe there neither i got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which i expected might roll down upon me i was no sooner stept down upon the firm ground but i plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake for the ground i stood on shook three times at about eight minutes distance with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth and a great piece of the top of a rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terrible noise as i never heard in all my life i perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it and i believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island i was so amazed with the thing itself having never felt the like or discoursed with any one that had that i was like one dead or stupified and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick like one that was tossed at sea but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me as it were and rousing me from the stupified condition i was in filled me with horror and i thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods and burying all at once and this sunk my very soul within me a second time after the third shock was over and i felt no more for some time i began to take courage and yet i had not heart enough to get over my wall again for fear of being buried alive but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate not knowing what to do all this while i had not the least serious religious thought nothing but the common lord have mercy upon me and when it was over that went away too while i sat thus i found the air overcast and grow cloudy as if it would rain soon after that the wind rose by little and little so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth the shore was covered with the breach of the water the trees were torn up by the roots and a terrible storm it was and this held about three hours and then began to abate and in two hours more it was stark calm and began to rain very hard all this while i sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected when on a sudden it came into my thoughts that these winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake the earthquake itself was spent and over and i might venture into my cave again with this thought my spirits began to revive and the rain also helping to persuade me i went in and sat down in my tent but the rain was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it and i was forced to go into my cave though very much afraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on my head this violent rain forced me to a new work viz to cut a hole through my new fortification like a sink to let water go out which would else have drowned my cave after i had been in my cave some time and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow i began to be more composed and now to support my spirits which indeed wanted it very much i went to my little store and took a small sup of rum which however i did then and always very sparingly knowing i could have no more when that was gone it continued raining all that night and great part of the next day so that i could not stir abroad but my mind being more composed i began to think of what i had best do concluding that if the island was subject to these earthquakes there would be no living for me in a cave but i must consider of building me some little hut in an open place which i might surround with a wall as i had done here and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men but concluded if i staid where i was i should certainly one time or other be buried alive with these thoughts i resolved to remove my tent from the place where it stood which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill and which if it should be shaken again would certainly fall upon my tent and i spent the two next days being the 19th and 20th of april in contriving where and how to remove my habitation the fear of being swallowed up alive made me that i never slept in quiet and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it but still when i looked about and saw how every thing was put in order how pleasantly concealed i was and how safe from danger it made me very loth to remove in the meantime it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this and that i must be contented to run the venture where i was till i had formed a camp for myself and had secured it so as to remove to it so with this resolution i composed myself for a time and resolved that i would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables c in a circle as before and set my tent up in it when it was finished but that i would venture to stay where i was till it was finished and fit to remove to this was the 21st april 22 the next morning i began to consider of means to put this resolve in execution but i was at a great loss about my tools i had three large axes and abundance of hatchets for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the indians but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood they were all full of notches and dull and though i had a grindstone i could not turn it and grind my tools too this cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics or a judge upon the life and death of a man at length i contrived a wheel with a string to turn it with my foot that i might have both my hands at liberty note i had never seen any such thing in england or at least not to take notice how it was done though since i have observed it is very common there besides that my grindstone was very large and heavy this machine cost me a full week s work to bring it to perfection april 28 29 these two whole days i took up in grinding my tools my machine for turning my grindstone performing very well april 30 having perceived my bread had been low a great while now i took a survey of it and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day which made my heart very heavy may 1 in the morning looking towards the sea side the tide being low i saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary and it looked like a cask when i came to it i found a small barrel and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship which were driven on shore by the late hurricane and looking towards the wreck itself i thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do i examined the barrel which was driven on shore and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder but it had taken water and the powder was caked as hard as a stone however i rolled it farther on shore for the present and went on upon the sands as near as i could to the wreck of the ship to look for more when i came down to the ship i found it strangely removed the forecastle which lay before buried in sand was heaved up at least six foot and the stern which was broke to pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the sea soon after i had left rummaging her was tossed as it were up and cast on one side and the sand was thrown so high on that side next her stern that whereas there was a great place of water before so that i could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming i could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out i was surprised with this at first but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake and as by this violence the ship was more broken open than formerly so many things came daily on shore which the sea had loosened and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land this wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my habitation and i busied myself mightily that day especially in searching whether i could make any way into the ship but i found nothing was to be expected of that kind for that all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand however as i had learnt not to despair of any thing i resolved to pull every thing to pieces that i could of the ship concluding that every thing i could get from her would be of some use or other to me may 3 i began with my saw and cut a piece of a beam through which i thought held some of the upper part or quarter deck together and when i had cut it through i cleared away the sand as well as i could from the side which lay highest but the tide coming in i was obliged to give over for that time way 4 i went a fishing but caught not one fish that i durst eat of till i was weary of my sport when just going to leave off i caught a young dolphin i had made me a long line of some rope yarn but i had no hooks yet i frequently caught fish enough as much as i cared to eat all which i dried in the sun and ate them dry may 5 worked on the wreck cut another beam asunder and brought three great fir planks off from the decks which i tied together and made swim on shore when the tide of flood came on may 6 worked on the wreck got several iron bolts out of her and other pieces of iron work worked very hard and came home very much tired and had thoughts of giving it over may 7 went to the wreck again but with an intent not to work but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down the beams being cut that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose and the inside of the hold lay so open that i could see into it but almost full of water and sand may 8 went to the wreck and carried an iron crow to wrench up the deck which lay now quite clear of the water or sand i wrenched open two planks and brought them on shore also with the tide i left the iron crow in the wreck for next day may 9 went to the wreck and with the crow made way into the body of the wreck and felt several casks and loosened them with the crow but could not break them up i felt also the roll of english lead and could stir it but it was too heavy to remove may 10 11 12 13 14 went every day to the wreck and got a great many pieces of timber and boards or plank and two or three hundred weight of iron may 15 i carried two hatchets to try if i could not cut a piece off the roll of lead by placing the edge of one hatchet and driving it with the other but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water i could not make any blow to drive the hatchet may 16 it had blown hard in the night and the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water but i staid so long in the woods to get pigeons for food that the tide prevented me going to the wreck that day may 17 i saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore at a great distance near two miles off me but resolved to see what they were and found it was a piece of the head but too heavy for me to bring away may 24 every day to this day i worked on the wreck and with hard labour i loosened some things so much with the crow that the first flowing tide several casks floated out and two of the seamen s chests but the wind blowing from the shore nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber and a hogshead which had some brasil pork in it but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it i continued this work every day to the 15th of june except the time necessary to get food which i always appointed during this part of my employment to be when the tide was up that i might be ready when it was ebbed out and by this time i had gotten timber and plank and iron work enough to have built a good boat if i had known how and also i got at several times and in several pieces near one hundred weight of the sheet lead june 16 going down to the sea side i found a large tortoise or turtle this was the first i had seen which it seems was only my misfortune not any defect of the place or scarcity for had i happened to be on the other side of the island i might have had hundreds of them every day as i found afterwards but perhaps had paid dear enough for them june 17 i spent in cooking the turtle i found in her threescore eggs and her flesh was to me at that time the most savory and pleasant that ever i tasted in my life having had no flesh but of goats and fowls since i landed in this horrid place june 18 rained all day and i stayed within i thought at this time the rain felt cold and i was something chilly which i knew was not usual in that latitude june 19 very ill and shivering as if the weather had been cold june 20 no rest all night violent pains in my head and feverish june 21 very ill frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of my sad condition to be sick and no help prayed to god for the first time since the storm off hull but scarce knew what i said or why my thoughts being all confused june 22 a little better but under dreadful apprehensions of sickness june 23 very bad again cold and shivering and then a violent headach june 24 much better june 25 an ague very violent the fit held me seven hours cold fit and hot with faint sweats after it june 26 better and having no victuals to eat took my gun but found myself very weak however i killed a she goat and with much difficulty got it home and broiled some of it and ate i would fain have stewed it and made some broth but had no pot june 27 the ague again so violent that i lay abed all day and neither ate or drank i was ready to perish for thirst but so weak i had not strength to stand up or to get myself any water to drink prayed to god again but was light headed and when i was not i was so ignorant that i knew not what to say only i lay and cried lord look upon me lord pity me lord have mercy upon me i suppose i did nothing else for two or three hours till the fit wearing off i fell asleep and did not wake till far in the night when i waked i found myself much refreshed but weak and exceeding thirsty however as i had no water in my whole habitation i was forced to lie till morning and went to sleep again in this second sleep i had this terrible dream i thought that i was sitting on the ground on the outside of my wall where i sat when the storm blew after the earthquake and that i saw a man descend from a great black cloud in a bright flame of fire and light upon the ground he was all over as bright as a flame so that i could but just bear to look towards him his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful impossible for words to describe when he stepped upon the ground with his feet i thought the earth trembled just as it had done before in the earthquake and all the air looked to my apprehension as if it had been filled with flashes of fire he was no sooner landed upon the earth but he moved forward towards me with a long spear or weapon in his hand to kill me and when he came to a rising ground at some distance he spoke to me or i heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it all that i can say i understood was this seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance now thou shall die at which words i thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me no one that shall ever read this account will expect that i should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision i mean that even while it was a dream i even dreamed of those horrors nor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when i awaked and found it was but a dream i had alas no divine knowledge what i had received by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series for eight years of seafaring wickedness and a constant conversation with nothing but such as were like myself wicked and profane to the last degree i do not remember that i had in all that time one thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward god or inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways but a certain stupidity of soul without desire of good or conscience of evil had entirely overwhelmed me and i was all that the most hardened unthinking wicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be not having the least sense either of the fear of god in danger or of thankfulness to god in deliverances in the relating what is already past of my story this will be the more easily believed when i shall add that through all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me i never had so much as one thought of it being the hand of god or that it was a just punishment for my sin my rebellious behaviour against my father or my present sins which were great or so much as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life when i was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of africa i never had so much as one thought of what would become of me or one wish to god to direct me whither i should go or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me as well from voracious creatures as cruel savages but i was merely thoughtless of a god or a providence acted like a mere brute from the principles of nature and by the dictates of common sense only and indeed hardly that when i was delivered and taken up at sea by the portugal captain well used and dealt justly and honourably with as well as charitably i had not the least thankfulness on my thoughts when again i was shipwrecked ruined and in danger of drowning on this island i was as far from remorse or looking on it as a judgment i only said to myself often that i was an unfortunate dog and born to be always miserable it is true when i got on shore first here and found all my ship s crew drowned and myself spared i was surprised with a kind of ecstasy and some transports of soul which had the grace of god assisted might have come up to true thankfulness but it ended where it begun in a mere common flight of joy or as i may say being glad i was alive without the least reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand which had preserved me and had singled me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed or an inquiry why providence had been thus merciful to me even just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have after they have got safe on shore from a shipwreck which they drown all in the next bowl of punch and forget almost as soon as it is over and all the rest of my life was like it even when i was afterwards on due consideration made sensible of my condition how i was cast on this dreadful place out of the reach of human kind out of all hope of relief or prospect of redemption as soon as i saw but a prospect of living and that i should not starve and perish for hunger all the sense of my affliction wore off and i began to be very easy applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition as a judgment from heaven or as the hand of god against me these were thoughts which very seldom entered into my head the growing up of the corn as is hinted in my journal had at first some little influence upon me and began to affect me with seriousness as long as i thought it had something miraculous in it but as soon as ever that part of thought was removed all the impression which was raised from it wore off also as i have noted already even the earthquake though nothing could be more terrible in its nature or more immediately directing to the invisible power which alone directs such things yet no sooner was the first fright over but the impression it had made went off also i had no more sense of god or his judgments much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from his hand than if i had been in the most prosperous condition of life but now when i began to be sick and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place itself before me when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever conscience that had slept so long began to awake and i began to reproach myself with my past life in which i had so evidently by uncommon wickedness provoked the justice of god to lay me under uncommon strokes and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner these reflections oppressed me from the second or third day of my distemper and in the violence as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience extorted some words from me like praying to god though i cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires or with hopes it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress my thoughts were confused the convictions great upon my mind and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions and in these hurries of my soul i knew not what my tongue might express but it was rather exclamation such as lord what a miserable creature am i if i should be sick i shall certainly die for want of help and what will become of me then the tears burst out of my eyes and i could say no more for a good while in this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind and presently his prediction which i mentioned in the beginning of this story viz that if i did take this foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery now said i aloud my dear father s words are come to pass god s justice has overtaken me and i have none to help or hear me i rejected the voice of providence which had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein i might have been happy and easy but i would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents i left them to mourn over my folly and now i am left to mourn under the consequences of it i refused their help and assistance who would have lifted me into the world and would have made every thing easy to me and now i have difficulties to struggle with too great for even nature itself to support and no assistance no help no comfort no advice then i cried out lord be my help for i am in great distress this was the first prayer if i might call it so that i had made for many years but i return to my journal june 28 having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep i had had and the fit being entirely off i got up and though the fright and terror of my dream was very great yet i considered that the fit of the ague would return again the next day and now was my time to get something to refresh and support myself when i should be ill and the first thing i did i filled a large square case bottle with water and set it upon my table in reach of my bed and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water i put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it and mixed them together then i got me a piece of the goat s flesh and broiled it on the coals but could eat very little i walked about but was very weak and withal very sad and heavy hearted under a sense of my miserable condition dreading the return of my distemper the next day at night i made my supper of three of the turtle s eggs which i roasted in the ashes and ate as we call it in the shell and this was the first bit of meat i had ever asked god s blessing to even as i could remember in my whole life after i had eaten i tried to walk but found myself so weak that i could hardly carry the gun for i never went out without that so i went but a little way and sat down upon the ground looking out upon the sea which was just before me and very calm and smooth as i sat here some such thoughts as these occurred to me what is the earth and sea of which i have seen so much whence is it produced and what am i and all the other creatures wild and tame human and brutal whence are we sure we are all made by some secret power who formed the earth and sea the air and sky and who is that then it followed most naturally it is god that has made it all well but then it came on strangely if god has made all these things he guides and governs them all and all things that concern them for the being that could make all things must certainly have power to guide and direct them if so nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works either without his knowledge or appointment and if nothing happens without his knowledge he knows that i am here and am in a dreadful condition and if nothing happens without his appointment he has appointed all this to befal me nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these conclusions and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befal me that i was brought to this miserable circumstance by his direction he having the sole power not of me only but of every thing that happened in the world immediately it followed why has god done this to me what have i done to be thus used my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry as if i had blasphemed and methought it spoke to me like a voice wretch dost thou ask what thou hast done look back upon a dreadful mispent life and ask thyself what thou hast not done ask why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man of war devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa or drowned here when all the crew perished but thyself dost thou ask what have i done i was struck with these reflections as one astonished and had not a word to say no not to answer to myself but rose up pensive and sad walked back to my retreat and went up over my wall as if i had been going to bed but my thoughts were sadly disturbed and i had no inclination to sleep so i sat down in my chair and lighted my lamp for it began to be dark now as the apprehensions of the return of my distemper terrified me very much it occurred to my thought that the brasilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests which was quite cured and some also that was green and not quite cured i went directed by heaven no doubt for in this chest i found a cure both for soul and body i opened the chest and found what i looked for viz the tobacco and as the few books i had saved lay there too i took out one of the bibles which i mentioned before and which to this time i had not found leisure or so much as inclination to look into i say i took it out and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table what use to make of the tobacco i knew not as to my distemper or whether it was good for it or no but i tried several experiments with it as if i was resolved it should hit one way or other i first took a piece of a leaf and chewed it in my mouth which indeed at first almost stupified my brain the tobacco being green and strong and that i had not been much used to it then i took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum and resolved to take a dose of it when i lay down and lastly i burnt some upon a pan of coals and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as i could bear it as well for the heat as the virtue of it and i held almost to suffocation in the interval of this operation i took up the bible and began to read but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading at least at that time only having opened the book casually the first words that occurred to me were these call on me in the day of trouble and i will deliver and thou shalt glorify me the words were very apt to my case and made some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them though not so much as they did afterwards for as for being delivered the word had no sound as i may say to me the thing was so remote so impossible in my apprehension of things that i began to say as the children of israel did when they were promised flesh to eat can god spread a table in the wilderness so i began to say can god himself deliver me from this place and as it was not for many years that any hope appeared this prevailed very often upon my thoughts but however the words made a very great impression upon me and i mused upon them very often it grew now late and the tobacco had as i said dozed my head so much that i inclined to sleep so that i left my lamp burning in the cave lest i should want any thing in the night and went to bed but before i lay down i did what i never had done in all my life i kneeled down and prayed to god to fulfil the promise to me that if i called upon him in the day of trouble he would deliver me after my broken and imperfect prayer was over i drank the rum in which i had steeped the tobacco which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that indeed i could scarce get it down immediately upon this i went to bed and i found presently it flew up into my head violently but i fell into a sound sleep and waked no more till by the sun it must necessarily be near three o clock in the afternoon the next day nay to this hour i am partly of the opinion that i slept all the next day and night and till almost three the day after for otherwise i knew not how i should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week as it appeared some years after i had done for if i had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line i should have lost more than a day but in my account it was lost and i never knew which way be that however one way or other when i awaked i found myself exceedingly refreshed and my spirits lively and cheerful when i got up i was stronger than i was the day before and my stomach better for i was hungry and in short i had no fit the next day but continued much altered for the better this was the 29th the 30th was my well day of course and i went abroad with my gun but did not care to travel too far i killed a sea fowl or two something like a brand goose and brought them home but was not very forward to eat them so i ate some more of the turtle s eggs which were very good this evening i renewed the medicine which i had supposed did me good the day before viz the tobacco steeped in rum only i did not take so much as before nor did i chew any of the leaf or hold my head over the smoke however i was not so well the next day which was the 1st of july as i hoped i should have been for i had a little spice of the cold fit but it was not much july 2 i renewed the medicine all the three ways and dozed myself with it at first and doubled the quantity which i drank july 3 i missed the fit for good and all though i did not recover my full strength for some weeks after while i was thus gathering strength my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture i will deliver thee and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind in bar of my ever expecting it but as i was discouraging myself with such thoughts it occurred to my mind that i pored so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction that i disregarded the deliverance i had received and i was as it were made to ask myself such questions as these viz have i not been delivered and wonderfully too from sickness from the most distressed condition that could be and that was so frightful to me and what notice had i taken of it had i done my part god had delivered me but i had not glorified him that is to say i had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance and how could i expect greater deliverance this touched my heart very much and immediately i kneeled down and gave god thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness july 4 in the morning i took the bible and beginning at the new testament i began seriously to read it and imposed upon myself to read a while every morning and every night not tying myself to the number of chapters but as long as my thoughts should engage me it was not long after i set seriously to this work but i found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life the impression of my dream revived and the words all these things have not brought thee to repentance ran seriously in my thoughts i was earnestly begging of god to give me repentance when it happened providentially the very day that reading the scripture i came to these words he is exalted a prince and a saviour to give repentance and to give remission i threw down the book and with my heart as well as my hand lifted up to heaven in a kind of ecstasy of joy i cried out aloud jesus thou son of david jesus thou exalted prince and saviour give me repentance this was the first time that i could say in the true sense of the words that i prayed in all my life for now i prayed with a sense of my condition and with a true scripture view of hope founded on the encouragement of the word of god and from this time i may say i began to have hope that god would hear me now i began to construe the words mentioned above call on me and i will deliver thee in a different sense from what i had ever done before for then i had no notion of any thing being called deliverance but my being delivered from the captivity i was in for though i was indeed at large in the place yet the island was certainly a prison to me and that in the worst sense in the world but now i learnt to take it in another sense now i looked back upon my past life with such horror and my sins appeared so dreadful that my soul sought nothing of god but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort as for my solitary life it was nothing i did not so much as pray to be delivered from it or think of it it was all of no consideration in comparison of this and i added this part here to hint to whoever shall read it that whenever they come to a true sense of things they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from affliction but leaving this part i return to my journal my condition began now to be though not less miserable as to my way of living yet much easier to my mind and my thoughts being directed by a constant reading the scripture and praying to god to things of a higher nature i had a great deal of comfort within which till now i knew nothing of also as my health and strength returned i bestirred myself to furnish myself with every thing that i wanted and make my way of living as regular as i could from the 4th of july to the 14th i was chiefly employed in walking about with my gun in my hand a little and a little at a time as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness for it is hardly to be imagined how low i was and to what weakness i was reduced the application which i made use of was perfectly new and perhaps what had never cured an ague before neither can i recommend it to any one to practise by this experiment and though it did carry off the fit yet it rather contributed to weaken me for i had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time i learnt from it also this in particular that being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be especially in those rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind for as the rain which came in a dry season was always most accompanied with such storms so i found this rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in september and october i had been now in this unhappy island above ten months all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me and i firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place having now secured my habitation as i thought fully to my mind i had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island and to see what other productions i might find which yet i knew nothing of it was the 15th of july that i began to take a more particular survey of the island itself i went up the creek first where as i hinted i brought my rafts on shore i found after i came about two miles up that the tide did not flow any higher and that it was no more than a little brook of running water and very fresh and good but this being the dry season there was hardly any water in some parts of it at least not enough to run into any stream so as it could be perceived on the bank of this brook i found many pleasant savannas or meadows plain smooth and covered with grass and on the rising parts of them next to the higher grounds where the water as it might be supposed never overflowed i found a great deal of tobacco green and growing to a great and very strong stalk there were divers other plants which i had no notion of or understanding about and might perhaps have virtues of their own which i could not find out i searched for the cassave root which the indians in all that climate make their bread of but i could find none i saw large plants of aloes but did not then understand them i saw several sugar canes but wild and for want of cultivation imperfect i contented myself with these discoveries for this time and came back musing with myself what course i might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which i should discover but could bring it to no conclusion for in short i had made so little observation while i was in the brasils that i knew little of the plants of the field at least very little that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress the next day the 16th i went up the same way again and after going something farther than i had done the day before i found the brook and the savannas began to cease and the country became more woody than before in this part i found different fruits and particularly i found melons upon the ground in great abundance and grapes upon the trees the vines had spread indeed over the trees and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime very ripe and rich this was a surprising discovery and i was exceeding glad of them but i was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them remembering that when i was ashore in barbary the eating of grapes killed several of our englishmen who were slaves there by throwing them into fluxes and fevers but i found an excellent use for these grapes and that was to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept which i thought would be as indeed they were as wholesome and as agreeable to eat when no grapes might be had i spent all that evening there and went not back to my habitation which by the way was the first night as i might say i had lain from home in the night i took my first contrivance and got up into a tree where i slept well and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery travelling near four miles as i might judge by the length of the valley keeping still due north with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me at the end of this march i came to an opening where the country seemed to descend to the west and a little spring of fresh water which issued out of the side of the hill by me ran the other way that is due east and the country appeared so fresh so green so flourishing every thing being in a constant verdure or flourish of spring that it looked like a planted garden i descended a little on the side of that delicious valley surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure though mixed with other afflicting thoughts to think that this was all my own that i was king and lord of all this country indefeasibly and had a right of possession and if i could convey it i might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in england i saw here abundance of cocoa trees orange and lemon and citron trees but all wild and few bearing any fruit at least not then however the green limes that i gathered were not only pleasant to eat but very wholesome and i mixed their juice afterwards with water which made it very wholesome and very cool and refreshing i found now i had business enough to gather and carry home and resolved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limes and lemons to furnish myself for the wet season which i knew was approaching in order to do this i gathered a great heap of grapes in one place and a lesser heap in another place and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place and taking a few of each with me i travelled homeward and resolved to come again and bring a bag or sack or what i could make to carry the rest home accordingly having spent three days in this journey i came home so i must now call my tent and my cave but before i got thither the grapes were spoiled the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised them they were good for little or nothing as to the limes they were good but i could bring but a few the next day being the 19th i went back having made me two small bags to bring home my harvest but i was surprised when coming to my heap of grapes which were so rich and fine when i gathered them i found them all spread abroad trod to pieces and dragged about some here some there and abundance eaten and devoured by this i concluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this but what they were i knew not however as i found there was no laying them up on heaps and no carrying them away in a sack but that one way they would be destroyed and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight i took another course for i gathered a large quantity of the grapes and hung them upon the out branches of the trees that they might cure and dry in the sun and as for the limes and lemons i carried as many back as i could well stand under when i came home from this journey i contemplated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness of that valley and the pleasantness of the situation the security from storms on that side of the water and the wood and concluded that i had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by far the worst part of the country upon the whole i began to consider of removing my habitation and to look out for a place equally safe as where i now was situated if possible in that pleasant fruitful part of the island this thought ran long in my head and i was exceeding fond of it for some time the pleasantness of the place tempting me but when i came to a nearer view of it and to consider that i was now by the sea side where it was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage and that the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place and though it was scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen yet to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage and to render such an affair not only improbable but impossible and that therefore i ought not by any means to remove however i was so enamoured with this place that i spent much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the month of july and though upon second thoughts i resolved as above not to remove yet i built me a little kind of a bower and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence being a double hedge as high as i could reach well staked and filled between with brushwood and here i lay very secure sometimes two or three nights together always going over it with a ladder as before so that i fancied now i had my country house and my sea coast house and this work took me up the beginning of august i had but newly finished my fence and began to enjoy my labour but the rains came on and made me stick close to my first habitation for though i had made me a tent like the other with a piece of a sail and spread it very well yet i had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary about the beginning of august as i said i had finished my bower and began to enjoy myself the 3d of august i found the grapes i had hung up were perfectly dried and indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun so i began to take them down from the trees and it was very happy that i did so for the rains which followed would have spoiled them and i had lost the best part of my winter food for i had above two hundred large bunches of them no sooner had i taken them all down and carried most of them home to my cave but it began to rain and from thence which was the 14th of august it rained more or less every day till the middle of october and sometimes so violently that i could not stir out of my cave for several days in this season i was much surprised with the increase of my family i had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats who ran away from me or as i thought had been dead and i heard no more tale or tidings of her till to my astonishment she came home about the end of august with three kittens this was the more strange to me because though i had killed a wild cat as i called it with my gun yet i thought it was a quite different kind from our european cats yet the young cats were the same kind of house breed like the old one and both my cats being females i thought it very strange but from these three cats i afterwards came to be so pestered with cats that i was forced to kill them like vermin or wild beasts and to drive them from my house as much as possible from the 14th of august to the 26th incessant rain so that i could not stir and was now very careful not to be much wet in this confinement i began to be straitened for food but venturing out twice i one day killed a goat and the last day which was the 26th found a very large tortoise which was a treat to me and my food was regulated thus i ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast a piece of the goat s flesh or of the turtle for my dinner broiled for to my great misfortune i had no vessel to boil or stew any thing and two or three of the turtle s eggs for supper during this confinement in my cover by the rain i worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave and by degrees worked it on towards one side till i came to the outside of the hill and made a door or way out which came beyond my fence or wall and so i came in and out this way but i was not perfectly easy at lying so open for as i had managed myself before i was in a perfect enclosure whereas now i thought i lay exposed and yet i could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear the biggest creature that i had seen upon the island being a goat september the 30th i was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing i cast up the notches on my post and found i had been on shore three hundred and sixty five days i kept this day as a solemn fast setting it apart to a religious exercise prostrating myself to the ground with the most serious humiliation confessing myself to god acknowledging his righteous judgment upon me and praying to him to have mercy on me through jesus christ and having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours even till the going down of the sun i then ate a biscuit cake and a bunch of grapes and went to bed finishing the day as i began it i had all this time observed no sabbath day for as at first i had no sense of religion upon my mind i had after some time omitted to distinguish the weeks by making a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath day and so did not really know what any of the days were but now having cast up the days as before i found i had been there a year so i divided it into weeks and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath though i found at the end of my account i had lost a day or two of my reckoning a little after this my ink began to fail me and so i contented myself to use it more sparingly and to write down only the most remarkable events of my life without continuing a daily memorandum of other things the rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me and i learnt to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly but i bought all my experience before i had it and this i am going to relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that i made at all i have mentioned that i had saved the few ears of barley and rice which i had so surprisingly found spring up as i thought of themselves and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice and about twenty of barley and now i thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains the sun being in its southern position going from me accordingly i dug up a piece of ground as well as i could with my wooden spade and dividing it into two parts i sowed my grain but as i was sowing it casually occurred to my thought that i would not sow it all at first because i did not know when was the proper time for it so i sowed about two thirds of the seeds leaving about a handful of each it was a great comfort to me afterwards that i did so for not one grain of that i sowed this time came to any thing for the dry months following the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown it had no moisture to assist its growth and never came up at all till the wet season had come again and then it grew as if it had been newly sown finding my first seed did not grow which i easily imagined was by the drought i sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial in and i dug up a piece of ground near my new bower and sowed the rest of my seed in february a little before the vernal equinox and this having the rainy months of march and april to water it sprung up very pleasantly and yielded a very good crop but having part of the seed left only and not daring to sow all that i had yet i had but a small quantity at last my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind but by this experience i was made master of my business and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow and that i might expect two seed times and two harvests every year while this corn was growing i made a little discovery which was of use to me afterwards as soon as the rains were over and the weather began to settle which was about the month of november i made a visit up the country to my bower where though i had not been some months yet i found all things just as i left them the circle or double hedge that i had made was not only firm and entire but the stakes which i had cut off of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long branches as much as a willow tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head i could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from i was surprised and yet very well pleased to see the young trees grow and i pruned them and led them up to grow as much alike as i could and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty five yards in diameter yet the trees for such i might now call them soon covered it and it was a complete shade sufficient to lodge under all the dry season this made me resolve to cut some more stakes and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle round my wall i mean that of my first dwelling which i did and placing the trees or stakes in a double row at above eight yards distance from my first fence they grew presently and were at first a fine cover to my habitation and afterwards served for a defence also as i shall observe in its order i found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided not into summer and winter as in europe but into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons which were generally thus half february rainy the sun being then on or near march the equinox half april half april may dry the sun being then to the north june of the line july half august september rain the sun being then come back half october half october november dry the sun being then to the south december of the line january half february the rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened to blow but this was the general observation i made after i had found by experience the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain i took care to furnish myself with provision beforehand that i might not be obliged to go out and i sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months in this time i found much employment and very suitable also to the time for i found great occasion of many things which i had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application particularly i tried many ways to make myself a basket but all the twigs i could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing it proved of excellent advantage to me now that when i was a boy i used to take great delight in standing at a basket maker s in the town where my father lived to see them make their wicker ware and being as boys usually are very officious to help and a great observer of the manner how they worked those things and sometimes lent an hand i had by this means so full knowledge of the methods of it that i wanted nothing but the materials when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence i cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows and willows and osiers in england and i resolved to try accordingly the next day i went to my country house as i called it and cutting some of the smaller twigs i found them to my purpose as much as i could desire whereupon i came the next time prepared with an hatchet to cut down a quantity which i soon found for there was a great plenty of them these i set up to dry within my circle or hedges and when they were fit for use i carried them to my cave and here during the next season i employed myself in making as well as i could a great many baskets both to carry earth or to carry or lay up any thing as i had occasion and though i did not finish them very handsomely yet i made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose and thus afterwards i took care never to be without them and as my wicker ware decayed i made more especially i made strong deep baskets to place my corn in instead of sacks when i should come to have any quantity of it having mastered this difficulty and employed a world of time about it i bestirred myself to see if possible how to supply two wants i had no vessels to hold any thing that was liquid except two rundlets which were almost full of rum and some glass bottles some of the common size and others which were case bottles square for the holding of waters spirits c i had not so much as a pot to boil any thing in except a great kettle which i saved out of the ship and which was too big for such uses as i desired it for viz to make broth and stew a bit of meat by itself the second thing i would fain have had was a tobacco pipe but it was impossible for me to make one however i found a contrivance for that too at last i employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes of piles and in this wicker work all the summer or dry season when another business took me up more time than it could be imagined i could spare i mentioned before that i had a great mind to see the whole island and that i had travelled up the brook and so on to where i built my bower and where i had an opening quite to the sea on the other side of the island i now resolved to travel quite across to the sea shore on that side so taking my gun and hatchet and my dog and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual with two biscuit cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store i began my journey when i had passed the vale where my bower stood as above i came within view of the sea to the west and it being a very clear day i fairly descried land whether an island or continent i could not tell but it lay very high extending from the west to the w s w at a very great distance by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off i could not tell what part of the world this might be otherwise than that i knew it must be part of america and as i concluded by all my observations must be near the spanish dominions and perhaps was all inhabited by savages where if i should have landed i had been in a worse condition than i was now and therefore i acquiesced in the dispositions of providence which i began now to own and to believe ordered every thing for the best i say i quieted my mind with this and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there besides after some pause upon this affair i considered that if this land was the spanish coast i should certainly one time or other see some vessels pass or repass one way or other but if not then it was the savage coast between the spanish country and brasil which were indeed the worst of savages for they are cannibals or men eaters and fail not to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands with these considerations i walked very leisurely forward i found that side of the island where i now was much pleasanter than mine the open or savanna fields sweet adorned with flowers and grass and full of very fine woods i saw abundance of parrots and fain would i have caught one if possible to have kept it to be tame and taught it to speak to me i did after some painstaking catch a young parrot for i knocked it down with a stick and having recovered it i brought it home but it was some years before i could make him speak however at last i taught him to call me by my name very familiarly but the accident that followed though it be a trifle will be very diverting in its place i was exceedingly diverted with this journey i found in the low grounds hares as i thought them to be and foxes but they differed greatly from all the other kinds i had met with nor could i satisfy myself to eat them though i killed several but i had no need to be venturous for i had no want of food and of that which was very good too especially these three sorts viz goats pigeons and turtle or tortoise which added to my grapes leadenhall market could not have furnished a better table than i in proportion to the company and though my case was deplorable enough yet i had great cause for thankfulness that i was not driven to any extremities for food but rather plenty even to dainties i never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day or thereabouts but i look so many turns and returns to see what discoveries i could make that i came weary enough to the place where i resolved to sit down for all night and then either reposed myself in a tree or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the ground either from one tree to another or so as no wild creature could come at me without waking me as soon as i came to the sea shore i was surprised to see that i had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island for here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles whereas on the other side i had found but three in a year and an half here was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds some of which i had not seen before and many of them very good meat but such as i knew not the names of except those called penguins i could have shot as many as i pleased but was very sparing of my powder and shot and therefore had more mind to kill a she goat if i could which i could better feed on and though there were many goats here more than on the other side of the island yet it was with much more difficulty that i could come near them the country being flat and even and they saw me much sooner than when i was on the hills i confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine but yet i had not the least inclination to remove for as i was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me and i seemed all the while i was here to be as it were upon a journey and from home however i travelled along the shore of the sea towards the east i suppose about twelve miles and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark i concluded i would go home again and the next journey i took should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling and so round till i came to my post again of which in its place i took another way to come back than that i went thinking i could easily keep all the island so much in my view that i could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country but i found myself mistaken for being come about two or three miles i found myself descended into a very large valley but so surrounded with hills and those hills covered with woods that i could not see which was my way by any direction but that of the sun nor even then unless i knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the day it happened to my farther misfortune that the weather proved hazy for three or four days while i was in this valley and not being able to see the sun i wandered about very uncomfortably and at last was obliged to find out the sea side look for my post and come back the same way i went and then by easy journies i turned homeward the weather being exceeding hot and my gun ammunition hatchet and other things very heavy in this journey my dog surprised a young kid and seized upon it and i running in to take hold of it caught it and saved it alive from the dog i had a great mind to bring it home if i could for i had often been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two and so raise a breed of tame goats which might supply me when my powder and shot should be spent i made a collar for this little creature and with a string which i made of some rope yarn which i always carried about me i led him along though with some difficulty till i came to my bower and there i enclosed him and left him for i was very impatient to be at home from whence i had been absent above a month i cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old hutch and lie down in my hammock bed this little wandering journey without a settled place of abode had been so unpleasant to me that my own house as i called it to myself was a perfect settlement to me compared to that and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable that i resolved i would never go a great way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the island i reposed myself here a week to rest and regale myself after my long journey during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my pol who began now to be a mere domestic and to be mighty well acquainted with me then i began to think of the poor kid which i had pent in within my little circle and resolved to go and fetch it home and give it some food accordingly i went and found it where i left it for indeed it could not get out but was almost starved for want of food i went and cut boughs of trees and branches of such shrubs as i could find and threw it over and having fed it i tied it as i did before to lead it away but it was so tame with being hungry that i had no need to have tied it for it followed me like a dog and as i continually fed it the creature became so loving so gentle and so fond that it became from that time one of my domestics also and would never leave me afterwards the rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come and i kept the 30th of september in the same solemn manner as before being the anniversary of my landing on the island having now been there two years and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day i came there i spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable i gave humble and hearty thanks that god had been pleased to discover to me even that it was possible i might be more happy in this solitary condition than i should have been in a liberty of society and in all the pleasures of the world that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state and the want of human society by his presence and the communication of his grace to my soul supporting comforting and encouraging me to depend upon his providence here and hope for his eternal presence hereafter it was now that i began sensibly to feel how much more happy the life i now led was with all its miserable circumstances than the wicked cursed abominable life i led all the past part of my days and now having changed both my sorrows and my joys my very desires altered my affections changed their gust and my delights were perfectly new from what they were at first coming or indeed for the two years past before as i walked about either on my hunting or for viewing the country the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden and my very heart would die within me to think of the woods the mountains the deserts i was in and how i was a prisoner locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean in an uninhabited wilderness without redemption in the midst of the greatest composures of my mind this would break out upon me like a storm and made me wring my hands and weep like a child sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work and i would immediately sit down and sigh and look upon the ground for an hour or two together and this was still worse to me for if i could burst out into tears or vent myself by words it would go off and the grief having exhausted itself would abate but now i began to exercise myself with new thoughts i daily read the word of god and applied all the comforts of it to my present state one morning being very sad i opened the bible upon these words i will never never leave thee nor forsake thee immediately it occurred that these words were to me why else should they be directed in such a manner just at the moment when i was mourning over my condition as one forsaken of god and man well then said i if god does not forsake me of what ill consequence can it be or what matters it though the world should all forsake me seeing on the other hand if i had all the world and should lose the favour and blessing of god there would be no comparison in the loss from this moment i began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken solitary condition than it was probable i should have ever been in any other particular state in the world and with this thought i was going to give thanks to god for bringing me to this place i know not what it was but something shocked my mind at that thought and i durst not speak the words how canst thou be such an hypocrite said i even audibly to pretend to be thankful for a condition which however thou mayst endeavour to be contented with thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from so i stopped there but though i could not say i thanked god for being there yet i sincerely gave thanks to god for opening my eyes by whatever afflicting providences to see the former condition of my life and to mourn for my wickedness and repent i never opened the bible or shut it but my very soul within me blessed god for directing my friend in england without any order of mine to pack it up among my goods and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship thus and in this disposition of mind i began my third year and though i have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my works this year as at the first yet in general it may be observed that i was very seldom idle having regularly divided my time according to the several daily employments that were before me such as first my duty to god and reading the scriptures which i constantly set apart some time for thrice every day secondly the going abroad with my gun for food which generally took me up three hours every morning when it did not rain thirdly the ordering curing preserving and cooking what i had killed or catched for my supply these took up great part of the day also it is to be considered that in the middle of the day when the sun was in the zenith the violence of the heat was too great to stir out so that about four hours in the evening was all the time i could be supposed to work in with this exception that sometimes i changed my hours of hunting and working and went to work in the morning and abroad with my gun in the afternoon to this short time allowed for labour i desire may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work the many hours which for want of tools want of help and want of skill every thing that i did took up out of my time for example i was full two and forty days making me a board for a long shelf which i wanted in my cave whereas two sawyers with their tools and saw pit would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day my case was this it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down because my board was to be a broad one the tree i was three days a cutting down and two more cutting off the boughs and reducing it to a log or piece of timber with inexpressible hacking and hewing i reduced both the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to move then i turned it and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end then turning that side downward cut the other side till i brought the plank to be about three inches thick and smooth on both sides any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work but labour and patience carried me through that and many other things i only observe this in particular to shew the reason why so much of my time went away with so little work viz that what might be a little to be done with help and tools was a vast labour and required a prodigious time to do alone and by hand but notwithstanding this with patience and labour i went through many things and indeed ever thing that my circumstances made necessary for me to do as will appear by what follows i was now in the months of november and december expecting my crop of barley and rice the ground i had manured or dug up for them was not great for as i observed my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck for i had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season but now my crop promised very well when on a sudden i found i was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts which it was scarce possible to keep from it as first the goats and wild creatures which i called hares which tasting the sweetness of the blade lay in it night and day as soon as it came up and ate it so close that it could get no time to shoot up into stalks this i saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a hedge which i did with a great deal of toil and the more because it required a great deal of speed the creatures daily spoiling my corn however as my arable land was but small suited to my crop i got it totally well fenced in about three weeks time and shooting some of the creatures in the day time i set my dog to guard it in the night tying him up to a stake at the gate where he would stand and bark all night long so in a little time the enemies forsook the place and the corn grew very strong and well and began to ripen apace but as the beasts ruined me before while my corn was in the blade so the birds were as likely to ruin me now when it was in the ear for going along by the place to see how it throve i saw my little crop surrounded with fowls of i know not how many sorts which stood as it were watching till i should be gone i immediately let fly among them for i always had my gun with me i had no sooner shot but there arose up a little cloud of fowls which i had not seen at all from among the corn itself this touched me sensibly for i foresaw that in a few days they would devour all my hopes that i should be starved and never be able to raise a crop at all and what to do i could not tell however i resolved not to lose my corn if possible though i should watch it night and day in the first place i went among it to see what damage was already done and found they had spoiled a good deal of it but that as it was yet too green for them the loss was not so great but the remainder was like to be a good crop if it could be saved i stayed by it to load my gun and then coming away i could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me as if they only waited till i was gone away and the event proved it to be so for as i walked off as if i was gone i was no sooner out of their sight but they dropped down one by one into the corn again i was so provoked that i could not have patience to stay till more came on knowing that every grain that they ate now was as it might be said a peck loaf to me in the consequence but coming up to the hedge i fired again and killed three of them this was what i wished for so i took them up and served them as we serve notorious thieves in england viz hanged them in chains for a terror to others it is impossible to imagine almost that this should have such an effect as it had for the fowls would not only not come at the corn but in short they forsook all that part of the island and i could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there this i was very glad of you may be sure and about the latter end of december which was our second harvest of the year i reaped my corn i was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down and all i could do was to make one as well as i could out of one of the broad swords or cutlasses which i saved among the arms out of the ship however as my crop was but small i had no great difficulty to cut it down in short i reaped it my way for i cut nothing off but the ears and carried it away in a great basket which i had made and so rubbed it out with my hands and at the end of all my harvesting i found that out of my half peck of seed i had near two bushels of rice and above two bushels and a half of barley that is to say by my guess for i had no measure at that time however this was a great encouragement to me and i foresaw that in time it would please god to supply me with bread and yet here i was perplexed again for i neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn or indeed how to clean it and part it nor if made into meal how to make bread of it and if how to make it yet i knew not how to bake it these things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store and to secure a constant supply i resolved not to taste any of this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next season and in the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread it might be truly said that i now worked for my bread it is a little wonderful and what i believe few people have thought much upon viz the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing producing curing dressing making and finishing this one article of bread i that was reduced to a mere state of nature found this to be my daily discouragement and was made more and more sensible of it every hour even after i got the first handful of seed corn which as i have said came up unexpectedly and indeed to a surprise first i had no plough to turn the earth no spade or shovel to dig it well this i conquered by making a wooden spade as i observed before but this did my work but in a wooden manner and though it cost me a great many days to make it yet for want of iron it not only wore out the sooner but made my work the harder and made it be performed much worse however this i bore with too and was content to work it out with patience and bear with the badness of the performance when the corn was sowed i had no harrow but was forced to go over it myself and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it to scratch the earth as it may be called rather than rake or harrow it when it was growing or grown i have observed already how many things i wanted to fence it secure it mow or reap it cure or carry it home thresh part it from the chaff and save it then i wanted a mill to grind it sieves to dress it yeast and salt to make it into bread and an oven to bake it in and all these things i did without as shall be observed and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too but all this as i said made every thing laborious and tedious to me but that there was no help for neither was my time so much loss to me because i had divided it a certain part of it was every day appointed to these works and as i resolved to use none of the corn for bread till i had a greater quantity by me i had the next six months to apply myself wholly by labour and invention to furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations necessary for the making the corn when i had it fit for my use but first i was to prepare more land for i had now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground before i did this i had a week s work at least to make me a spade which when it was done was a very sorry one indeed and very heavy and required double labour to work with it however i went through that and sowed my seeds in two large flat pieces of ground as near my house as i could find them to my mind and fenced them in with a good hedge the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which i had set before which i knew would grow so that in one year s time i knew i should have a quick or living hedge that would want but little repair this work was not so little as to take me up less than three months because great part of that time was in the wet season when i could not go abroad within door that is when it rained and i could not go out i found employment on the following occasion always observing that all the while i was at work i diverted myself with talking to my parrot and teaching him to speak and i quickly learnt him to know his own name at last to speak it out pretty loud pol which was the first word i ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own this therefore was not my work but an assistant to my work for now as i said i had a great employment upon my hands as follows viz i had long studied by some means or other to make myself some earthen vessels which indeed i wanted sorely but knew not where to come at them however considering the heat of the climate i did not doubt but if i could find out any such clay i might botch up some such pot as might being dried by the sun be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling and to hold any thing that was dry and required to be kept so and as this was necessary in preparing corn meal c which was the thing i was upon i resolved to make some as large as i could and fit only to stand like jars to hold what should be put into them it would make the reader pity me or rather laugh at me to tell how many awkward ways i look to raise this paste what odd misshapen ugly things i made how many of them fell in and how many fell out the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight how many cracked by the over violent heat of the sun being set out too hastily and how many fell to pieces with only removing as well before as after they were dried and in a word how after having laboured hard to find the clay to dig it to temper it to bring it home and work it i could not make above two large earthen ugly things i cannot call them jars in about two months labour however as the sun baked these two very dry and hard i lifted them very gently up and set them down again in two great wicker baskets which i had made on purpose for them that they might not break and as between the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare i stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw and these two pots being to stand always dry i thought would hold my dry corn and perhaps the meal when the corn was bruised though i miscarried so much in my design for large pots yet i made several smaller things with better success such as little round pots flat dishes pitchers and pipkins and any thing my hand turned to and the heat of the sun baked them strangely hard but all this would not answer my end which was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid and bear the fire which none of these could do it happened after some time making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat when i went to put it out after i had done with it i found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire burnt as hard as a stone and red as a tile i was agreeably surprised to see it and said to myself that certainly they might be made to burn whole if they would burn broken this set me to study how to order my fire so as to make it burn me some pots i had no notion of a kiln such as the potters burn in or of glazing them with lead though i had some lead to do it with but i placed three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile one upon another and placed my fire wood all round it with a great heap of embers under them i piled the fire with fresh fuel round the outside and upon the top till i saw the pots in the inside red hot quite through and observed that they did not crack at all when i saw them clear red i let them stand in that heat about five or six hours till i found one of them though it did not crack did melt or run for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat and would have run into glass if i had gone on so i slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the red colour and watching them all night that i might not let the fire abate too fast in the morning i had three very good i will not say handsome pipkins and two other earthen pots as hard burnt as could be desired and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand after this experiment i need not say that i wanted no sort of earthenware for my use but i must needs say as to the shapes of them they were very indifferent as any one may suppose when i had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies or as a woman would make pies that never learnt to raise paste no joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine when i found i had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire and i had hardly patience to stay till they were cold before i set one upon the fire again with some water in it to boil me some meat which i did admirably well and with a piece of a kid i made some very good broth though i wanted oatmeal and several other ingredients requisite to make it so good as i would have had it my next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in for as to the mill there was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands to supply this want i was at a great loss for of all trades in the world i was as perfectly unqualified for a stone cutter as for any whatever neither had i any tools to go about it with i spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and could find none at all except what was in the solid rock and which i had no way to dig or cut out nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient but were all of a sandy crumbling stone which would neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle nor would break the corn without filling it with sand so after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone i gave it over and resolved to look out a great block of hard wood which i found indeed much easier and getting one as big as i had strength to stir i rounded it and formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet and then with the help of fire and infinite labour made an hollow place in it as the indians in brasil make their canoes after this i made a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood called the iron wood and this i prepared and laid by against i had my next crop of corn when i proposed to myself to grind or rather pound my corn or meal to make my bread my next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce to dress my meal and part it from the bran and the husk without which i did not see it possible i could have any bread this was a most difficult thing so much as but to think on for to be sure i had nothing like the necessary things to make it with i mean fine thin canvass or stuff to searce the meal through and here i was at a full stop for many months nor did i really know what to do linen i had none left but what was mere rags i had goat s hair but neither knew i how to weave or spin it and had i known how here were no tools to work it with all the remedy that i found for this was that at last i did remember i had among the seamen s clothes which were saved out of the ship some neckcloths of calico or muslin and with some pieces of these i made three small sieves but proper enough for the work and thus i made shift for some years how i did afterwards i shall shew in its place the baking part was the next thing to be considered and how i should make bread when i came to have corn for first i had no yeast as to that part there was no supplying the want so i did not concern myself much about it but for an oven i was indeed in great pain at length i found out an experiment for that also which was this i made some earthen vessels very broad but not deep that is to say about two feet diameter and not above nine inches deep these i burnt in the fire as i had done the other and laid them by and when i wanted to bake i made a great fire upon the hearth which i had paved with some square tiles of my own making and burning also but i should not call them square when the fire wood was burnt pretty much into embers or live coals i drew them forward upon this hearth so as to cover it all over and there i let them lie till the hearth was very hot then sweeping away all the embers i set down my loaf or loaves and whelming down the earthen pot upon them drew the embers all round the outside of the pot to keep in and add to the heat and thus as well as in the best oven in the world i baked my barley loaves and became in a little time a mere pastry cook into the bargain for i made myself several cakes of the rice and puddings indeed i made no pies neither had i any thing to put into them supposing i had except the flesh either of fowls or goats it need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of the third year of my abode here for it is to be observed that in the intervals of these things i had my new harvest and husbandry to manage for i reaped my corn in its season and carried it home as well as i could and laid it up in the ear in my large baskets till i had time to rub it out for i had no floor to thresh it on or instrument to thresh it with and now indeed my stock of corn increasing i really wanted to build my barns bigger i wanted a place to lay it up in for the increase of the corn now yielded me so much that i had of the barley about twenty bushels and of the rice as much or more insomuch that i now resolved to begin to use it freely for my bread had been quite gone a great while also i resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year and to sow but once a year upon the whole i found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were much more than i could consume in a year so i resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that i sowed the last in hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread c all the while these things were doing you may be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which i had seen from the other side of the island and i was not without secret wishes that i was on shore there fancying that seeing the main land and an inhabited country i might find some way or other to convey myself farther and perhaps at last find some means of escape but all this while i made no allowance for the dangers of such a condition and how i might fall into the hands of savages and perhaps such as i might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of africa that if i once came into their power i should run an hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed and perhaps of being eaten for i had heard that the people of the caribean coasts were cannibals or men eaters and i knew by the latitude that i could not be far off from that shore that suppose they were not cannibals yet they might kill me as many europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served even when they had been ten or twenty together much more i that was but one and could make little or no defence all these things i say which i ought to have considered well of and i did cast up in my thoughts afterwards yet took none of my apprehensions at first and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting over to that shore now i wished for my boy xury and the long boat with the shoulder of mutton sail with which i sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of africa but this was in vain then i thought i would go and look on our ship s boat which as i have said was blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm when we were first cast away she lay almost where she did at first but not quite and was turned by the force of the waves and the winds almost bottom upwards against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand but no water about her as before if i had had hands to have refitted her and have launched her into the water the boat would have done well enough and i might have gone back into the brasils with her easy enough but i might have easily foreseen that i could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom than i could remove the island however i went to the wood and cut levers and rollers and brought them to the boat resolving to try what i could do suggesting to myself that if i could but turn her down i might easily repair the damage she had received and she would be a very good boat and i might go to sea in her very easily i spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil and spent i think three or four weeks about it at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my little strength i fell to digging away the sand to undermine it and so to make it fall down setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall but when i had done this i was unable to stir it up again or to get under it much less to move it forwards towards the water so i was forced to give it over and yet though i gave over the hopes of the boat my desire to venture over for the main increased rather than decreased as the means for it seemed impossible this at length set me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua such as the natives of those climates make even without tools or as i might say without hands viz of the trunk of a great tree this i not only thought possible but easy and pleased myself extremely with my thoughts of making it and with my having much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or indians but not at all considering the particular inconveniences which i lay under more than the indians did viz want of hands to move it into the water when it was made a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them for what was it to me that when i had chosen a vast tree in the woods i might with great trouble cut it down if after i might be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a proper shape of a boat and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow so to make a boat of it if after all this i must leave it just there where i found it and was not able to launch it into the water one would have thought i could not have had the least reflection upon my mind of this circumstance while i was making this boat but i should have immediately thought how i should get it into the sea but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it that i never once considered how i should get it off the land and it was really in its own nature more easy for me to guide it over forty five miles of sea than about forty five fathoms of land where it lay to set it afloat in the water i went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did who had any of his senses awake i pleased myself with the design without determining whether i was ever able to undertake it not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head but i put a stop to my own inquiries into it by this foolish answer which i gave myself let me first make it i ll warrant i ll find some way or other to get it along when it is done this was a most preposterous method but the eagerness of my fancy prevailed and to work i went and felled a cedar tree i question much whether solomon ever had such an one for the building the temple at jerusalem it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty two feet after which it lessened for a while and then parted into branches it was not without infinite labour that i felled this tree i was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom i was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head of it cut off which i hacked and hewed through with my axe and hatchet with inexpressible labour after this it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion and to something like the bottom of a boat that it might swim upright as it ought to do it cost me near three months more to clear the inside and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it this i did indeed without fire by mere mallet and chissel and by the dint of hard labour till i had brought it to be a very handsome periagua and big enough to have carried six and twenty men and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo when i had gone through this work i was extremely delighted with it the boat was really much bigger than i ever saw a canoe or periagua that was made of one tree in my life many a weary stroke it had cost you may be sure for there remained nothing but to get it into the water and had i gotten it into the water i make no question but i should have begun the maddest voyage and the most unlikely to be performed that ever was undertaken but all my devices to get it into the water failed me though they cost infinite labour too it lay about one hundred yards from the water and not more but the first inconvenience was it was up hill towards the creek well to take away this discouragement i resolved to dig into the surface of the earth and so make a declivity this i began and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains but who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view but when this was worked through and this difficulty managed it was still much at one for i could no more stir the canoe than i could the other boat then i measured the distance of ground and resolved to cut a dock or canal to bring the water up to the canoe seeing i could not bring the canoe down to the water well i began this work and when i began to enter into it and calculated how deep it was to be dug how broad how the stuff to be thrown out i found that by the number of hands i had being none but my own it must have been ten or twelve years before i should have gone through with it for the shore lay high so that at the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep so at length though with great reluctancy i gave this attempt over also this grieved me heartily and now i saw though too late the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost and before we judge lightly of our own strength to go through with it in the middle of this work i finished my fourth year in this place and kept my anniversary with the same devotion and with as much comfort as ever before for by a constant study and serious application of the word of god and by the assistance of his grace i gained a different knowledge from what i had before i entertained different notions of things i looked now upon the world as a thing remote which i had nothing to do with no expectation from and indeed no desires about in a word i had nothing indeed to do with it nor was ever like to have so i thought it looked as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter viz as a place i had lived in but was come out of it and well i might say as father abraham to dives between me and thee there is a great gulf fixed in the first place i was removed from all the wickedness of the world here i had neither the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye or the pride of life i had nothing to covet for i had all i was now capable of enjoying i was lord of the whole manor or if i pleased i might call myself king or emperor over the whole country which i had possession of there were no rivals i had no competitor none to dispute sovereignty or command with me i might have raised ship loadings of corn but i had no use for it so i let as little grow as i thought enough for my occasion i had tortoises or turtles enough but now and then one was as much as i could put to any use i had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships i had grapes enough to have made wine or to have cured into raisins to have loaded that fleet when they had been built but all i could make use of was all that was valuable i had enough to eat and to supply my wants and what was all the rest to me if i killed more flesh than i could eat the dog must eat it or the vermin if i sowed more corn than i could eat it must be spoiled the trees that i cut down were lying to rot on the ground i could make no more use of them than for fuel and that i had no occasion for but to dress my food in a word the nature and experience of things dictated to me upon just reflection that all the good things of this world are no farther good to us than as they are for our use and that whatever we may heap up indeed to give to others we enjoy as much as we can use and no more the most covetous griping miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had been in my case for i possessed infinitely more than i knew what to do with i had no room for desire except it was of things which i had not and they were but trifles though indeed of great use to me i had as i hinted before a parcel of money as well gold as silver about thirty six pounds sterling alas there the nasty sorry useless stuff lay i had no manner of business for it and i often thought with myself that i would have given an handful of it for a gross of tobacco pipes or for an hand mill to grind my corn nay i would have given it all for six penny worth of turnip and carrot seed out of england or for an handful of peas and beans and a bottle of ink as it was i had not the least advantage by it or benefit from it but there it lay in a drawer and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet season and if i had had the drawer full of diamonds it had been the same case and they had been of no manner of value to me because of no use i had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it was at first and much easier to my mind as well as to my body i frequently sat down to my meat with thankfulness and admired the hand of god s providence which had thus spread my table in the wilderness i learnt to look more upon the bright side of my condition and less upon the dark side and to consider what i enjoyed rather than what i wanted and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts that i cannot express them and which i take notice of here to put those discontented people in mind of it who cannot enjoy comfortably what god hath given them because they see and covet something that he has not given them all our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have another reflection was of great use to me and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was and this was to compare my present condition with what i at first expected it should be nay with what it would certainly have been if the good providence of god had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up near to the shore where i not only could come at her but could bring what i got out of her to the shore for my relief and comfort without which i had wanted tools to work weapons for defence or gunpowder and shot for getting my food i spent whole hours i may say whole days in representing to myself in the most lively colours how i must have acted if i had got nothing out of the ship how i could not have so much as got any food except fish and turtles and that as it was long before i found any of them i must have perished first that i should have lived if i had not perished like a mere savage that if i had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance i had no way to flay or open them or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels or to cut it up but must gnaw it with my teeth and pull it with my claws like a beast these reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of providence to me and very thankful for my present condition with all its hardships and misfortunes and this part also i cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt in their misery to say is any affliction like mine let them consider how much worse the cases of some people are and what their case might have been if providence had thought fit i had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort my mind with hopes and this was comparing my present condition with what i had deserved and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of providence i had lived a dreadful life perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of god i had been well instructed by father and mother neither had they been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse a religious awe of god into my mind a sense of my duty and of what the nature and end of my being required of me but alas falling early into the seafaring life which of all the lives is the most destitute of the fear of god though his terrors are always before them i say falling early into the seafaring life and into seafaring company all that little sense of religion which i had entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates by an hardened despising of dangers and the views of death which grew habitual to me by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse with any thing but what was like myself or to hear any thing of what was good or tended towards it so void was i of every thing that was good or of the least sense of what i was or was to be that in the greatest deliverance i enjoyed such as my escape from sallee my being taken up by the portuguese master of the ship my being planted so well in brasil my receiving the cargo from england and the like i never once had the words thank god so much as on my mind or in my mouth nor in the greatest distress had i so much thought as to pray to him nor so much as to say lord have mercy upon me no not to mention the name of god unless it was to swear by and blaspheme it i had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months as i have already observed on the account of my wicked and hardened life past and when i looked about me and considered what particular providences had attended me since my coming into this place and how god had dealt bountifully with me had not only punished me less than my iniquity deserved but had so plentifully provided for me this gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted and that god had yet mercies in store for me with these reflections i worked my mind up not only to resignation to the will of god in the present disposition of my circumstances but even to a sincere thankfulness of my condition and that i who was yet a living man ought not to complain seeing i had not the due punishment of my sins that i enjoyed so many mercies which i had no reason to have expected in that place that i ought never more to repine at my condition but to rejoice and to give daily thanks for that daily bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have brought that i ought to consider i had been fed even by a miracle even as great as that of feeding elijah by ravens nay by a long series of miracles and that i could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part of the world where i could have been cast more to my advantage a place where as i had no society which was my affliction on one hand so i found no ravenous beasts no furious wolves or tigers to threaten my life no venomous creatures or poisonous which i might have fed on to my hurt no savages to murder and devour me in a word as my life was a life of sorrow one way so it was a life of mercy another and i wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to be able to make my sense of god s goodness to me and care over me in this condition be my daily consolation and after i made a just improvement of these things i went away and was no more sad i had now been here so long that many things which i brought on shore for my help were either quite gone or very much wasted and near spent my ink as i observed had been gone for some time all but a very little which i eked out with water a little and a little till it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper as long as it lasted i made use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to me and first by casting up times past i remember that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various providences which befel me and which if i had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate i might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity first i had observed that the same day that i broke away from my father and my friends and ran away to hull in order to go to sea the same day afterwards i was taken by the sallee man of war and made a slave the same day of the year that i escaped out of the wreck of the ship in yarmouth roads that same day of the year afterwards i made my escape from sallee in the boat the same day of the year i was born on viz the 20th of september the same day i had my life so miraculously saved twenty six years after when i was cast on shore in this island so that my wicked life and solitary life both began on a day the next thing to my ink s being wasted was that of my bread i mean the biscuit which i brought out of the ship this i had husbanded to the last degree allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a year and yet i was quite without bread for a year before i got any corn of my own and great reason i had to be thankful that i had any at all the getting it being as has been already observed next to miraculous my clothes too began to decay mightily as to linen i had none a good while except some chequered shirts which i found in the chests of the other seamen and which i carefully preserved because many times i could bear no other clothes on but a shirt and it was a very great help to me that i had among all the men s clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts there were also several thick watch coats of the seamen which were left behind but they were too hot to wear and though it is true that the weather was so violent hot that there was no need of clothes yet i could not go quite naked no though i had been inclined to it which i was not nor could i abide the thought of it though i was all alone one reason why i could not go quite naked was i could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on nay the very heat frequently blistered my skin whereas with a shirt on the air itself made some motion and whistling under the shirt was twofold cooler than without it no more could i ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat the heat of the sun beating with such violence as it does in that place would give me the headach presently by darting so directly on my head without a cap or hat on so that i could not bear it whereas if i put on my hat it would presently go away upon these views i began to consider about putting the few rags i had which i called clothes into some order i had worn out all the waistcoats i had and my business was now to try if i could not make jackets out of the great watch coats which i had by me and with such other materials as i had so i set to work a tailoring or rather indeed a botching for i made most piteous work of it however i made shift to make two or three waistcoats which i hoped would serve me a great while as for breeches or drawers i made but very sorry shift indeed till afterwards i have mentioned that i saved the skins of all the creatures that i killed i mean four footed ones and i had hung them up stretched out with sticks in the sun by which means some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little but others it seems were very useful the first thing i made of these was a great cap for my head with the hair on the outside to shoot off the rain and this i performed so well that after this i made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins that is to say a waistcoat and breeches open at the knees and both loose for they were rather wanted to keep me cool than to keep me warm i must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made for if i was a bad carpenter i was a worse tailor however they were such as i made a very good shift with and when i was abroad if it happened to rain the hair of the waistcoat and cap being outmost i was kept very dry after this i spent a deal of time and pains to make me an umbrella i was indeed in great want of one and had a great mind to make one i had seen them made in the brasils where they are very useful in the great heats which are there and i felt the heats every jot as great here and greater too being nearer the equinox besides as i was obliged to be much abroad it was a most useful thing to me as well for the rains as the heats i took a world of pains at it and was a great while before i could make any thing likely to hold nay after i thought i had hit the way i spoiled two or three before i made one to my mind but at last i made one that answered indifferently well the main difficulty i found was to make it to let down i could make it to spread but if it did not let down too and draw in it would not be portable for me any way but just over my head which would not do however at last as i said i made one to answer i covered it with skins the hair upwards so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse and kept off the sun so effectually that i could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than i could before in the coolest and when i had no need of it i could close it and carry it under my arm thus i lived mighty comfortably my mind being entirely composed by resigning to the will of god and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his providence this made my life better than sociable for when i began to regret the want of conversation i would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts and as i hope i may say with even my maker by ejaculations and petitions was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world i cannot say that after this for five years any extraordinary thing happened to me but i lived on in the same course in the same posture and place just as before the chief thing i was employed in besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice and curing my raisins of both which i always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of the year s provisions beforehand i say besides this yearly labour and my daily labour of going out with my gun i had one labour to make me a canoe which at last i finished so that by digging a canal to it six feet wide and four feet deep i brought it into the creek almost half a mile as for the first that was so vastly big as i made it without considering beforehand as i ought to do how i should be able to launch it so never being able to bring it to the water or bring the water to it i was obliged to let it lie where it was as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time indeed the next time though i could not get a tree proper for it and was in a place where i could not get the water to it at any less distance than as i have said of near half a mile yet as i saw it was practicable at last i never gave it over and though i was near two years about it yet i never grudged my labour in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last however though my little periagua was finished yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the design which i had in view when i made the first i mean of venturing over to the terra firma where it was above forty miles broad accordingly the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design and now i thought no more of it but as i had a boat my next design was to make a tour round the island for as i had been on the other side in one place crossing as i have already described it over the land so the discoveries i made in that journey made me very eager to see the other parts of the coast and now i had a boat i thought of nothing but sailing round the island for this purpose and that i might do every thing with discretion and consideration i fitted up a little mast to my boat and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship s sails which lay in store and of which i had a great store by me having fitted my mast and sail and tried the boat i found she would sail very well then i made little lockers and boxes at each end of my boat to put provisions necessaries and ammunition c into to be kept dry either from rain or the spray of the sea and a little long hollow place i cut in the inside of the boat where i could lay my gun making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry i fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern like a mast to stand over my head and keep the heat of the sun off me like an awning and thus i every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea but never went far out nor far from the little creek but at last being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom i resolved upon my tour and accordingly i victualled my ship for the voyage putting in two dozen of my loaves cakes i should rather call them of barley bread an earthen pot full of parched rice a food i ate a great deal of a little bottle of rum half a goat and powder with shot for killing more and two large watch coats of those which as i mentioned before i had saved out of the seamen s chests these i took one to lie upon and the other to cover me in the night it was the 6th of november in the sixth year of my reign or my captivity which you please that i set out on this voyage and i found it much longer than i expected for though the island itself was not very large yet when i came to the east side of it i found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea some above water some under it and beyond this a shoal of sand lying dry half a league more so that i was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that point when i first discovered them i was going to give over my enterprise and come back again not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea and above all doubting how i should get back again so i came to an anchor for i had made me a kind of an anchor with a piece of broken grappling which i got out of the ship having secured my boat i took my gun and went on shore climbing up an hill which seemed to over look that point where i saw the full extent of it and resolved to venture in my viewing the sea from that hill where i stood i perceived a strong and indeed a most furious current which ran to the east even came close to the point and i took the more notice of it because i saw there might be some danger that when i came into it i might be carried out to sea by the strength of it and not be able to make the island again and indeed had i not gotten first upon this hill i believe it would have been so for there was the same current on the other side of the island only that it set off at a farther distance and i saw there was a strong eddy under the shore so i had nothing to do but to get out of the first current and i should presently be in an eddy i lay here however two days because the wind blowing pretty fresh at e s e and that being just contrary to the said current made a great breach of the sea upon the point so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach nor to go too far off because of the stream the third day in the morning the wind having abated over night the sea was calm and i ventured but i am a warning piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots for no sooner was i come to the point when i was not my boat s length from the shore but i found myself in a great depth of water and a current like a sluice of a mill it carried my boat along with it with such violence that all i could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it but i found it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy which was on the left hand there was no wind stirring to help me and all that i could do with my paddles signified nothing and now i began to give myself over for lost for as the current was on both sides the island i knew in a few leagues distance they must join again and then i was irrecoverably gone nor did i see any possibility of avoiding it so that i had no prospect before me but of perishing not by the sea for that was calm enough but of starving for hunger i had indeed found a tortoise on the shore as big almost as i could lift and had tossed it into the boat and i had a great jar of fresh water that is to say one of my earthen pots but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean where to be sure there was no shore no main land or island for a thousand leagues at least and now i saw how easy it was for the providence of god to make the most miserable condition that mankind could be in worse now i looked back upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be there again i stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes o happy desert said i i shall never see thee more o miserable creature said i whither am i going then i reproached myself with my unthankful temper and how i had repined at my solitary condition and now what would i give to be on shore there again thus we never see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries nor know how to value what we enjoy but by the want of it it is scarce possible to imagine the consternation i was now in being driven from my beloved island for so it appeared to me now to be into the wide ocean almost two leagues and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again however i worked hard till indeed my strength was almost exhausted and kept my boat as much to the northward that is towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on as possibly i could when about noon as the sun passed the meridian i thought i felt a little breeze of wind in my face springing up from the s s e this cheered my heart a little and especially when in about half an hour more it blew a pretty small gentle gale by this time i was gotten at a frightful distance from the island and had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened i had been undone another way too for i had no compass on board and should never have known how to have steered towards the island if i had but once lost sight of it but the weather continuing clear i applied myself to get up my mast again and spread my sail standing away to the north as much as possible to get out of the current just as i had set my mast and sail and the boat began to stretch away i saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current was near where the current was so strong the water was foul but perceiving the water clear i found the current abate and presently i found to the east at about half a mile a breach of the sea upon some rocks these rocks i found caused the current to part again and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly leaving the rocks to the north east so the other returned by the repulse of the rock and made a strong eddy which ran back again to the north west with a very sharp stream they who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the ladder or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them or who have been in such like extremities may guess what my present surprise of joy was and how gladly i put my boat into the stream of this eddy and the wind also freshening how gladly i spread my sail to it running cheerfully before the wind and with a strong tide or eddy under foot this eddy carried me about a league in my way back again directly towards the island but about two leagues more towards the northward than the current lay which carried me away at first so that when i came near the island i found myself open to the northern shore of it that is to say the other end of the island opposite to that which i went out from when i had made something more than a league of way by the help of this current or eddy i found it was spent and served me no farther however i found that being between the two great currents viz that on the south side which had hurried me away and that on the north which lay about two leagues on the other side i say between these two in the west of the island i found the water at least still and running no way and having still a breeze of wind fair for me i kept on steering directly for the island though not making such fresh way as i did before about four o clock in the evening being then within about a league of the island i found the point of the rocks which occasioned this distance stretching out as is described before to the southward and casting off the current more southwardly had of course made another eddy to the north and this i found very strong but directly setting the way my course lay which was due west but almost full north however having a fresh gale i stretched across this eddy slanting north west and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore where it being smooth water i soon got to land when i was on shore i fell on my knees and gave god thanks for my deliverance resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat and refreshing myself with such things as i had i brought my boat close to the shore in a little cove that i had espied under some trees and laid me down to sleep being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage i was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat i had run so much hazard and knew too much the case to think of attempting it by the way i went out and what might be at the other side i mean the west side i knew not nor had i any mind to run any more ventures so i only resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the shore and to see if there was no creek where i might lay up my frigate in safety so as to have her again if i wanted her in about three miles or thereabouts coasting the shore i came to a very good inlet or bay about a mile over which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook where i found a convenient harbour for my boat and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her here i put in and having stowed my boat very safe i went on shore to look about me and see where i was i soon found i had but a little passed by the place where i had been before when i travelled on foot to that shore so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella for it was exceeding hot i began my march the way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as i had been upon and i reached my old bower in the evening where i found every thing standing as i left it for i always kept it in good order being as i said before my country house i got over the fence and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs for i was very weary and fell asleep but judge you if you can that read my story what a surprise i must be in when i was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my name several times robin robin robin crusoe poor robin crusoe where are you robin crusoe where are you where have you been i was so dead asleep at first being fatigued with rowing or paddling as it is called the first part of the day and walking the latter part that i did not awake thoroughly and dozing between sleeping and waking thought i dreamed that somebody spoke to me but as the voice continued to repeat robin crusoe robin crusoe at last i began to awake more perfectly and was at first dreadfully frighted and started up in the utmost consternation but no sooner were my eyes open but i saw my pol sitting on the top of the hedge and immediately knew that this was he that spoke to me for just in such bemoaning language i had used to talk to him and teach him and he had learnt it so perfectly that he would sit upon my finger and lay his bill close to my face and cry poor robin crusoe where are you where have you been how came you here and such things as i had taught him however even though i knew it was the parrot and that indeed it could be nobody else it was a good while before i could compose myself first i was amazed how the creature got thither and then how he should just keep about the place and no where else but as i was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest poll i got it over and holding out my hand and calling him by his name poll the sociable creature came to me and sat upon my thumb as he used to do and continued talking to me poor robin crusoe and how did i come here and where had i been just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again and so i carried him home along with me i had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time and had enough to do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger i had been in i would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island but i knew not how it was practicable to get it about as to the east side of the island which i had gone round i knew well enough there was no venturing that way my very heart would shrink and my very blood run chill but to think of it and as to the other side of the island i did not know how it might be there but supposing the current ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the other i might run the same risk of being driven down the stream and carried by the island as i had been before of being carried away from it so with these thoughts i contented my self to be without any boat though it had been the product of so many months labour to make it and of so many more to get it unto the sea in this government of my temper i remained near a year lived a very sedate retired life as you may well suppose and my thoughts being very much composed as to my condition and fully comforted in resigning my self to the dispositions of providence i thought i lived really very happily in all things except that of society i improved my self in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my necessities put me upon applying my self to and i believe could upon occasion make a very good carpenter especially considering how few tools i had besides this i arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen ware and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel which i found infinitely easier and better because i made things round and shapeable which before were filthy things indeed to look on but i think i was never more vain of my own performance or more joyful for any thing i found out than for my being able to make a tobacco pipe and tho it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it was done and only burnt red like other earthen ware yet as it was hard and firm and would draw the smoke i was exceedingly comforted with it for i had been always used to smoke and there were pipes in the ship but i forgot them at first not knowing that there was tobacco in the island and afterwards when i searched the ship again i could not come at any pipes at all in my wicker ware also i improved much and made abundance of necessary baskets as well as my invention shewed me tho not very handsome yet they were such as were very handy and convenient for my laying things up in or fetching things home in for example if i killed a goat abroad i could hang it up in a tree flea it and dress it and cut it in pieces and bring it home in a basket and the like by a turtle i could cut it up take out the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh which was enough for me and bring them home in a basket and leave the rest behind me also large deep baskets were my receivers for my corn which i always rubbed out as soon as it was dry and cured and kept it in great baskets i began now to perceive my powder abated considerably and this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply and i began seriously to consider what i must do when i should have no more powder that is to say how i should do to kill any goat i had as is observed in the third year of my being here kept a young kid and bred her up tame and i was in hope of getting a he goat but i could not by any means bring it to pass till my kid grew an old goat and i could never find in my heart to kill her till she dyed at last of mere age but being now in the eleventh year of my residence and as i have said my ammunition growing low i set myself to study some art to trap and snare the goats to see whether i could not catch some of them alive and particularly i wanted a she goat great with young to this purpose i made snares to hamper them and believe they were more than once taken in them but my tackle was not good for i had no wire and always found them broken and my bait devoured at length i resolved to try a pitfall so i dug several large pits in the earth in places where i had observed the goats used to feed and over these pits i placed hurdles of my own making too with a great weight upon them and several times i put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the trap and i could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn that i could see the mark of their feet at length i set three traps in one night and going the next morning i found them all standing and yet the bait eaten and gone this was very discouraging however i altered my trap and not to trouble you with particulars going one morning to see my traps i found in one of them a large old he goat and in one of the other three kids a male and two females as to the old one i knew not what to do with him he was so fierce i durst not go into the pit to him that is to say to go about to bring him away alive which was what i wanted i could have killed him but that was not my business nor would it answer my end so i e en let him out and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits but i did not then know what i afterwards learnt that hunger would tame a lion if i had let him stay there three or four days without food and then have carried him some water to drink and then a little corn he would have been as tame as one of the kids for they are mighty sagacious tractable creatures where they are well used however for the present i let him go knowing no better at that time then i went to the three kids and taking them one by one i tied them with strings together and with some difficulty brought them all home it was a good while before they would feed but throwing them some sweet corn it tempted them and they began to be tame and now i found that if i expected to supply myself with goat s flesh when i had no powder or shot left breeding some up tame was my only way when perhaps i might have them about my house like a flock of sheep but then it presently occurred to me that i must keep the tame from the wild or else they would always run wild when they grew up and the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground well fenced either with hedge or pale to keep them up so effectually that those within might not break out or those without break in this was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet as i saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it my first piece of work was to find out a proper piece of ground viz where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat water for them to drink and cover to keep them from the sun those who understand such enclosures will think i had very little contrivance when i pitched upon a place very proper for all these being a plain open piece of meadow land or savanna as our people call it in the western colonies which had two or three little drills of fresh water in it and at one end was very woody i say they will smile at my forecast when i shall tell them i began my enclosing of this piece of ground in such a manner that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass for if it was ten miles about i was like to have time enough to do it in but i did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much compass as if they had had the whole island and i should have so much room to chase them in that i should never catch them my hedge was begun and carried on i believe about fifty yards when this thought occurred to me so i presently stopped short and for the first beginning i resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length and one hundred yards in breadth which as it would maintain as many as i should have in any reasonable time so as my flock increased i could add more ground to my enclosure this was acting with some prudence and i went to work with courage i was about three months hedging in the first piece and till i had done it i tethered the three kids in the best part of it and used them to feed as near me as possible to make them familiar and very often i would go and carry them some ears of barley or a handful of rice and feed them out of my hand so that after my enclosure was finished and i let them loose they would follow me up and down bleating after me for a handful of corn this answered my end and in about a year and a half i had a flock of about twelve goats kids and all and in two years more i had three and forty besides several that i took and killed for my food and after that i enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in with little pens to drive them into to take them as i wanted them and gates out of one piece of ground into another but this was not all for now i not only had goat s flesh to feed on when i pleased but milk too a thing which indeed in my beginning i did not so much as think of and which when it came into my thoughts was really an agreeable surprise for now i set up my dairy and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day and as nature who gives supplies of food to every creature dictates even naturally how to make use of it so i that never milked a cow much less a goat or saw butter or cheese made very readily and handily though after a great many essays and miscarriages made me both butter and cheese at last and never wanted it afterwards how mercifully can our great creator treat his creatures even in those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction how can he sweeten the bitterest providences and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons what a table was here spread for me in a wilderness where i saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger it would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit down to dinner there was my majesty the prince and lord of the whole island i had the lives of all my subjects at absolute command i could hang draw give life and liberty and take it away and no rebels among all my subjects then to see how like a king i dined too all alone attended by my servants pol as if he had been my favourite as the only person permitted to talk to me my dog which was now grown very old and crazy and found no species to multiply his kind upon sat always at my right hand and two cats one on one side the table and one on the other expecting now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of special favour but these were not the two cats which i brought on shore at first for they were both of them dead and had been interred near my habitation by my own hands but one of them having multiplied by i know not what kind of creature these were two which i preserved tame whereas the rest ran wild into the woods and became indeed troublesome to me at last for they would often come into my house and plunder me too till at last i was obliged to shoot them and did kill a great many at length they left me with this attendance and in this plentiful manner i lived neither could i be said to want any thing but society and of that in some time after this i was like to have too much i was something impatient as i had observed to have the use of my boat though very loath to run any more hazard and therefore sometimes i sat contriving ways to get her about the island and at other times i sat myself down contented enough without her but i had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island where as i have said in my last ramble i went up the hill to see how the shore lay and how the current set that i might see what i had to do this inclination increased upon me every day and at length i resolved to travel thither by land and following the edge of the shore i did so but had any one in england been to meet such a man as i was it must either have frighted them or raised a great deal of laughter and as i frequently stood still to look at myself i could not but smile at the notion of my travelling through yorkshire with such an equipage and in such a dress be pleased to take a sketch of my figure as follows i had a great high shapeless cap made of goat s skin with a flap hanging down behind as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes i had a short jacket of goat s skin the skirts coming down to about the middle of my thighs and a pair of open kneed breeches of the same the breeches were made of a skin of an old he goat whose hair hung down such a length on either side that like pantaloons it reached to the middle of my legs stockings and shoes i had none but i had made me a pair of something i scarce knew what to call them like buskins to flap over my legs and lace on either side like spatterdashes but of a most barbarous shape as indeed were all the rest of my clothes i had on a broad belt of goat s skin dried which i drew together with two thongs of the same instead of buckles and in a kind of a frog on either side of this instead of a sword and dagger hung a little saw and a hatchet one on one side one on the other i had another belt not so broad and fastened in the same manner which hung over my shoulder and at the end of it under my left arm hung two pouches both made of goat s skin too in one of which hung my powder in the other my shot at my back i carried my basket on my shoulder my gun and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat s skin umbrella but which after all was the most necessary thing i had about me next to my gun as for my face the colour of it was really not so mulatto like as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox my beard i had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long but as i had both scissars and razors sufficient i had cut it pretty short except what grew on my upper lip which i had trimmed into a large pair of mahometan whiskers such as i had seen worn by some turks whom i saw at sallee for the moors did not wear such though the turks did of these mustachios or whiskers i will not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them but they were of length and shape monstrous enough and such as in england would have passed for frightful but all this is by the by for as to my figure i had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence so i say no more to that part in this kind of figure i went my new journey and was out five or six days i travelled first along the sea shore directly to the place where i first brought my boat to an anchor to get up upon the rocks and having no boat now to take care of i went over the land a nearer way to the same height that i was upon before when looking forward to the point of the rock which lay out and which i was to double with my boat as i said above i was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet no rippling no motion no current any more there than in other places i was at a strange loss to understand this and resolved to spend some time in the observing of it to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it but i was presently convinced how it was viz that the tide of ebb setting from the west and joining with the current of waters from some great river on the shore must be the occasion of this current and that according as the wind blew more forcible from the west or from the north this current came near or went farther from the shore for waiting thereabouts till evening i went up to the rock again and then the tide of the ebb being made i plainly saw the current again as before only that it ran farther off being near half a league from the shore whereas in my case it set close upon the shore and hurried me in my canoe along with it which at another time it would not have done this observation convinced me that i had nothing to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide and i might very easily bring my boat about the island again but when i began to think of putting it in practice i had such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger i had been in that i could not think of it again with any patience but on the contrary i took up another resolution which was more safe though more laborious and this was that i would build or rather make me another periagua or canoe and so have one for one side of the island and one for the other you are to understand that now i had as i may call it two plantations in the island one my little fortification or tent with the wall about it under the rock with the cave behind me which by this time i had enlarged into several apartments or caves one within another one of these which was the driest and largest and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification that is to say beyond where my wall joined to the rock was all filled up with large earthen pots of which i have given an account and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets which would hold five or six bushels each where i laid up my stores of provision especially my corn some in the ear cut off short from the straw and the other rubbed out with my hands as for my wall made as before with long stakes or piles those piles grew all like trees and were by this time grown so big and spread so very much that there was not the least appearance to any one s view of any habitation behind them near this dwelling of mine but a little farther within the land and upon lower ground lay my two pieces of corn ground which i kept duly cultivated and sowed and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season and whenever i had occasion for more corn i had more land adjoining as fit as that besides this i had my country seat and i had now a tolerable plantation there also for first i had my little bower as i called it which i kept in repair that is to say i kept the hedge which circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height the ladder standing always in the inside i kept the trees which at first were no more than my stakes but were now grown very firm and tall i kept them always so cut that they might spread and grow thick and wild and make the more agreeable shade which they did effectually to my mind in the middle of this i had my tent always standing being a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose and which never wanted any repair or renewing and under this i had made me a squab or couch with the skins of the creatures i had killed and with other soft things and a blanket laid on them such as belonged to our sea bedding which i had saved and a great watch coat to cover me and here whenever i had occasion to be absent from my chief seat i took up my country habitation adjoining to this i had my enclosures for my cattle that is to say my goats and as i had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground i was so uneasy to see it kept entire lest the goats should break through that i never left off till with infinite labour i had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes and so near to one another that it was rather a pale than a hedge and there was scarce room to put a hand through between them which afterwards when those stakes grew as they all did in the next rainy season made the enclosure strong like a wall indeed stronger than any wall this will testify for me that i was not idle and that i spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support for i considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh milk butter and cheese for me as long as i lived in the place if it were to be forty years and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree that i might be sure of keeping them together which by this method indeed i so effectually secured that when these little stakes began to grow i had planted them so very thick i was forced to pull some of them up again in this place also i had my grapes growing which i principally depended on for my winter store of raisins and which i never failed to preserve very carefully as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet and indeed they were not agreeable only but physical wholesome nourishing and refreshing to the last degree as this was also about half way between my other habitation and the place where i had laid up my boat i generally staid and lay here in my way thither for i used frequently to visit my boat and i kept all things about or belonging to her in very good order sometimes i went out in her to divert myself but no more hazardous voyages would i go nor scarce ever above a stone s cast or two from the shore i was so apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds or any other accident but now i come to a new scene of my life it happened one day about noon going towards my boat i was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man s naked foot on the shore which was very plain to be seen in the sand i stood like one thunder struck or as if i had seen an apparition i listened i looked round me i could hear nothing nor see any thing i went up to a rising ground to look farther i went up the shore and down the shore but it was all one i could see no other impression but that one i went to it again to see if there were any more and to observe if it might not be my fancy but there was no room for that for there was exactly the very print of a foot toes heel and every part of a foot how it came thither i knew not nor could in the least imagine but after innumerable fluttering thoughts like a man perfectly confused and out of myself i came home to my mortification not feeling as we say the ground i went on but terrified to the last degree looking behind me at every two or three steps mistaking every bush and tree and fancying every stump at a distance to be a man nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes an affrighted imagination represented things to me in how many wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way when i came to my castle for so i think i called it ever after this i fled into it like one pursued whether i went over by the ladder as first contrived or went in at the hole in the rock which i called a door i cannot remember for never frighted hare fled to cover or fox to earth with more terror of mind than i to this retreat i had no sleep that night the farther i was from the occasion of my fright the greater my apprehensions were which is something contrary to the nature of such things and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear but i was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing that i formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself even though i was now a great way off it sometimes i fancied it must be the devil and reason joined in with me upon this supposition for how should any other thing in human shape come into the place where was the vessel that brought them what marks were there of any other footsteps and how was it possible a man should come there but then to think that satan should take human shape upon him in such a place where there could be no manner of occasion for it but to leave the print of his foot behind him and that even for no purpose too for he could not be sure i should see it this was an amazement the other way i considered that the devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot that as i lived quite on the other side of the island he would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether i should ever see it or not and in the sand too which the first surge of the sea upon an high wind would have defaced entirely all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself and with all notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil and i presently concluded that it must be some more dangerous creature viz that it must be some of the savages of the main land over against me who had wandered out to sea in their canoes and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds had made the island and had been on shore but were gone away again to sea being as loath perhaps to have staid in this desolate island as i would have been to have had them while these reflections were rolling upon my mind i was very thankful in my thought that i was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time or that they did not see my boat by which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the place and perhaps have searched farther for me then terrible thoughts racked my imaginations about their having found my boat and that there were people here and that if so i should certainly have them come again in greater numbers and devour me that if it should happen so that they should not find me yet they would find my enclosure destroy all my corn carry away all my flock of tame goats and i should perish at last for mere want thus my fear banished all my religious hope all that former confidence in god which was founded upon such wonderful experience as i had had of his goodness now vanished as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve by his power the provision which he had made for me by his goodness i reproached myself with my uneasiness that i would not sow any more corn one year than would just serve me till the next season as if no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground and this i thought so just a reproof that i resolved for the future to have two or three years corn beforehand so that whatever might come i might not perish for want of bread how strange a chequer work of providence is the life of man and by what secret differing springs are the affections hurried about as differing circumstances present to day we love what to morrow we hate to day we seek what to morrow we shun to day we desire what to morrow we fear nay even tremble at the apprehensions of this was exemplified in me at this time in the most lively manner imaginable for i whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society that i was alone circumscribed by the boundless ocean cut off from mankind and condemned to what i call a silent life that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living or to appear among the rest of his creatures that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life and the greatest blessing that heaven itself next to the supreme blessing of salvation could bestow i say that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man s having set his foot on the island such is the uneven state of human life and it afforded me a great many curious speculations afterwards when i had a little recovered my first surprise i considered that this was the station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of god had determined for me that as i could not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this so i was not to dispute his sovereignty who as i was his creature had an undoubted right by creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit and who as i was a creature who had offended him had likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought fit and that it was my part to submit to bear his indignation because i had sinned against him i then reflected that god who was not only righteous but omnipotent as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me so he was able to deliver me that if he did not think fit to do it it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will and on the other hand it was my duty also to hope in him pray to him and quietly to attend the dictates and directions of his daily providence these thoughts took me up many hours days nay i may say weeks and months and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion i cannot omit viz one morning early lying in my bed and filled with thoughts about my danger from the appearance of savages i found it discomposed me very much upon which those words of the scripture came into my thoughts call upon me in the day of trouble and i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me upon this rising cheerfully out of my bed my heart was not only comforted but i was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to god for deliverance when i had done praying i took up my bible and opening it to read the first words that presented to me were wait on the lord and be of good cheer and he shall strengthen thy heart wait i say on the lord it is impossible to express the comfort this gave me and in return i thankfully laid down the book and was no more sad at least not on that occasion in the middle of these cogitations apprehensions and reflections it came into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of my own and that this foot might be the print of my own foot when i came on shore from my boat this cheered me up a little too and i began to persuade myself it was all a delusion that it was nothing else but my own foot and why might not i come that way from the boat as well as i was going that way to the boat again i considered also that i could by no means tell for certain where i had trod and where i had not and that if at last this was only the print of my own foot i had played the part of those fools who strive to make stories of spectres and apparitions and then are themselves frighted at them more than any body else now i began to take courage and to peep abroad again for i had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights so that i began to starve for provision for i had little or nothing within doors but some barley cakes and water then i knew that my goats wanted to be milked too which usually was my evening diversion and the poor creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it and indeed it almost spoiled some of them and almost dried up their milk heartening myself therefore with the belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet and so i might be truly said to start at my own shadow i began to go abroad again and went to my country house to milk my flock but to see with what fear i went forward how often i looked behind me how i was ready every now and then to lay down my basket and run for my life it would have made any one have thought i was haunted with an evil conscience or that i had been lately most terribly frighted and so indeed i had however as i went down thus two or three days and having seen nothing i began to be a little bolder and to think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination but i could not persuade myself fully of this till i should go down to the shore again and see this print of a foot and measure it by my own and see if there was any similitude or fitness that i might be assured it was my own foot but when i came to the place first it appeared evidently to me that when i laid up my boat i could not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts secondly when i came to measure the mark with my own foot i found my foot not so large by a great deal both these things filled my head with new imaginations and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree so that i shook with cold like one in an ague and i went home again filled with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there or in short that the island was inhabited and i might be surprised before i was aware and what course to take for my security i knew not o what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear it deprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their relief the first thing i proposed to myself was to throw down my enclosures and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods that the enemy might not find them and then frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like booty then to the simple thing of digging up my two corn fields that they might not find such a grain there and still to be prompted to frequent the island then to demolish my bower and tent that they might not see any vestiges of my habitation and be prompted to look farther in order to find out the persons inhabiting these were the subjects of the first night s cogitation after i was come home again while the apprehensions which had so over run my mind were fresh upon me and my head was full of vapours as above thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much than the evil which we are anxious about but which was worse than all this i had not that relief in this trouble from the resignation i used to practise that i hoped to have i looked i thought like saul who complained not only that the philistines were upon him but that god had forsaken him for i did not now take due ways to compose my mind by crying to god in my distress and resting upon his providence as i had done before for my defence and deliverance which if i had done i had at least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise and perhaps carried through it with more resolution this confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night but in the morning i fell asleep and having by the amusement of my mind been as it were tired and my spirits exhausted i slept very soundly and i awaked much better composed than i had ever been before and now i began to think sedately and upon the utmost debate with myself i concluded that this island which was so exceeding pleasant fruitful and no farther from the main land than as i had seen was not so entirely abandoned as i might imagine that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot yet that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore who either with design or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds might come to this place that i had lived here fifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people before and that if at any time they should be driven here it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they could seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon any occasion to this time that the most i could suggest any danger from was from any such casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main who as it was likely if they were driven hither were here against their wills so they made no stay here but went off again with all possible speed seldom staying one night on shore lest they should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again and that therefore i had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat in case i should see any savages land upon the spot now i began sorely to repent that i had dug my cave so large as to bring a door through again which door as i said came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock upon maturely considering this therefore i resolved to draw me a second fortification in the manner of a semicircle at a distance from my wall just where i had planted a double row of trees about twelve years before of which i made mention these trees having been planted so thick before there wanted but a few piles to be driven between them that they should be thicker and stronger and my wall would be soon finished so that i had now a double wall and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber old cables and every thing i could think of to make it strong having in it seven little holes about as big as i might put my arm out at in the inside of this i thickened my wall to about ten feet thick continually bringing earth out of my cave and laying it at the foot of the wall and walking upon it and through the seven holes i contrived to plant the muskets of which i took notice that i got seven on shore out of the ship these i say i planted like my cannon and fitted them into frames that held them like a carriage that so i could fire all the seven guns in two minutes time this wall i was many a weary month in finishing and yet never thought myself safe till it was done when this was done i stuck all the ground without my wall for a great way every way as full with stakes or sticks of the osier like wood which i found so apt to grow as they could well stand insomuch that i believe i might set in near twenty thousand of them leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall that i might have room to see an enemy and they might have no shelter from the young trees if they attempted to approach my outer wall thus in two years time i had a thick grove and in five or six years time i had a wood before my dwelling grown so monstrous thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable and no man of what kind soever would ever imagine that there was any thing beyond it much less an habitation as for the way i proposed myself to go in and out for i left no avenue it was by setting two ladders one to a part of the rock which was low and then broke in and left room to place another ladder upon that so when the two ladders were taken down no man living could come down to me without mischiefing himself and if they had come down they were still on the outside of my outer wall thus i took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own preservation and it will be seen at length that they were not altogether without just reason though i foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested while this was doing i was not altogether careless of my other affairs for i had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats they were not only a present supply to me upon every occasion and began to be sufficient for me without the expense of powder and shot but also abated the fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones and i was loath to lose the advantage of them and to have them all to nurse up over again to this purpose after long consideration i could think but of two ways to preserve them one was to find another convenient place to dig a cave under ground and to drive them into it every night and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land remote from one another and as much concealed as i could where i might keep about half a dozen young goats in each place so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general i might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time and this though it would require a great deal of time and labour i thought was the most rational design accordingly i spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island and i pitched upon one which was as private indeed as my heart could wish for it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods where as is observed i almost lost myself once before endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the island here i found a clear piece of land near three acres so surrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature at least it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other pieces of ground i had worked so hard at i immediately went to work with this piece of ground and in less than a month s time i had so fenced it round that my flock or herd call it which you please which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be were well enough secured in it so without any farther delay i removed ten she goats and two he goats to this piece and when there i continued to perfect the fence till i had made it as secure as the other which however i did at more leisure and it took me up more time by a great deal all this labour i was at the expense of purely from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a man s foot which i had seen for as yet i never saw any human creature come near the island and i had now lived two years under these uneasinesses which indeed made my life much less comfortable than it was before as may well be imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man and this i must observe with grief too that the discomposure of my mind had too great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits that i seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my maker at least not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which i was wont to do i rather prayed to god as under great affliction and pressure of mind surrounded with danger and in expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before the morning and i must testify from my experience that a temper of peace thankfulness love and affection is much more the proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure and that under the dread of mischief impending a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to god than he is for repentance on a sick bed for these discomposures affect the mind as the others do the body and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body and much greater praying to god being properly an act of the mind not of the body but to go on after i had thus secured one part of my little living stock i went about the whole island searching for another private place to make such another deposit when wandering more to the west point of the island than i had ever done yet and looking out to sea i thought i saw a boat upon the sea at a great distance i had found a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen s chests which i saved out of our ship but i had it not about me and this was so remote that i could not tell what to make of it though i looked at it till my eyes were not able to look any longer whether it was a boat or not i do not know but as i descended from the hill i could see no more of it so i gave it over only i resolved to go no more without a perspective glass in my pocket when i was come down the hill to the end of the island where indeed i had never been before i was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man s foot was not such a strange thing in the island as i imagined and but that it was a special providence that i was cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came i should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main when they happened to be a little too far out at sea to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour likewise as they often met and fought in their canoes the victors having taken any prisoners would bring them over to this shore where according to their dreadful customs being all cannibals they would kill and eat them of which hereafter when i was come down the hill to the shore as i said above being the s w point of the island i was perfectly confounded and amazed nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls hands feet and other bones of human bodies and particularly i observed a place where there had been a fire made and a circle dug in the earth like a cock pit where it is supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow creatures i was so astonished with the sight of these things that i entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman hellish brutality and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature which though i had heard of often yet i never had so near a view of before in short i turned away my face from the horrid spectacle my stomach grew sick and i was just at the point of fainting when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach and having vomited with an uncommon violence i was a little relieved but could not bear to stay in the place a moment so i got me up the hill again with all the speed i could and walked on towards my own habitation when i came a little out of that part of the island i stood still a while as amazed and then recovering myself i looked up with the utmost affection of my soul and with a flood of tears in my eyes gave god thanks that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where i was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these and that though i had esteemed my present condition very miserable had yet given me so many comforts in it that i had still more to give thanks for than to complain of and this above all that i had even in this miserable condition been comforted with the knowledge of himself and the hope of his blessing which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which i had suffered or could suffer in this frame of thankfulness i went home to my castle and began to be much easier now as to the safety of my circumstances than ever i was before for i observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get perhaps not seeking not wanting or not expecting any thing here and having often no doubt been up in the covered woody part of it without finding any thing to their purpose i knew i had been here now almost eighteen years and never saw the least footsteps of a human creature there before and might be here eighteen more as entirely concealed as i was now if i did not discover myself to them which i had no manner of occasion to do it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where i was unless i found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to yet i entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that i have been speaking of and of the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up that i continued pensive and sad and kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this when i say my own circle i mean by it my three plantations viz my castle my country seat which i called my bower and my enclosure in the woods nor did i look after this for any other use than as an enclosure for my goats for the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such that i was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself nor did i so much as go to look after my boat in all this time but began rather to think of making me another for i could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me lest i should meet with some of those creatures at sea in which if i had happened to have fallen into their hands i knew what would have been my lot time however and the satisfaction i had that i was in no danger of being discovered by these people began to wear off my uneasiness about them and i began to live just in the same composed manner as before only with this difference that i used more caution and kept my eyes more about me than i did before lest i should happen to be seen by any of them and particularly i was more cautious of firing my gun lest any of them on the island should happen to hear it and it was therefore a very good providence to me that i had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats that i had no need to hunt any more about the woods or shoot at them and if i did catch any more of them after this it was by traps and snares as i had done before so that for two years after this i believe i never fired my gun once off though i never went out without it and which was more as i had saved three pistols out of the ship i always carried them out with me or at least two of them sticking them in my goat skin belt i likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses that i had out of the ship and made me a belt to put it in also so that i was now a most formidable fellow to look at when i went abroad if you add to the former description of myself the particular of two pistols and a great broad sword hanging at my side in a belt but without a scabbard things going on thus as i have said for some time i seemed excepting these cautions to be reduced to my former calm sedate way of living all these things tended to shew me more and more how far my condition was from being miserable compared to some others nay to many other particulars of life which it might have pleased god to have made my lot it put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their condition with those that are worse in order to be thankful than be always comparing them with those which are better to assist their murmurings and complainings as in my present condition there were not really many things which i wanted so indeed i thought that the frights i had been in about these savage wretches and the concern i had been in for my own preservation had taken off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences and i had dropped a good design which i had once bent my thoughts upon and that was to try if i could not make some of my barley into malt and then try to brew myself some beer this was really a whimsical thought and i reproved myself often for the simplicity of it for i presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer that it would be impossible for me to supply as first casks to preserve it in which was a thing that as i have observed already i could never compass no though i spent not many days but weeks nay months in attempting it but to no purpose in the next place i had no hops to make it keep no yeast to make it work no copper or kettle to make it boil and yet had not all these things intervened i mean the frights and terrors i was in about the savages i had undertaken it and perhaps brought it to pass too for i seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing it when i once had it in my head enough to begin it but my invention now ran quite another way for night and day i could think of nothing but how i might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel bloody entertainment and if possible save the victim they should bring hither to destroy it would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances i hatched or rather brooded upon in my thoughts for the destroying these creatures or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more but all was abortive nothing could be possible to take effect unless i was to be there to do it myself and what could one man do among them when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together with their darts or their bows and arrows with which they could shoot as true to a mark as i could with my gun sometimes i contrived to dig a hole under the place where they made their fire and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder which when they kindled their fire would consequently take fire and blow up all that was near it but as in the first place i should be very loath to waste so much powder upon them my store being now within the quantity of a barrel so neither could i be sure of its going off at any certain time when it might surprise them and at best that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them but not sufficient to make them forsake the place so i laid it aside and then proposed that i would place myself in ambush in some convenient place with my three guns all double loaded and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them when i should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shoot and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and my sword i made no doubt but that if there were twenty i should kill them all this fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks and i was so full of it that i often dreamed of it and sometimes that i was just going to let fly at them in my sleep i went so far with it in my indignation that i employed myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade as i said to watch for them and i went frequently to the place itself which was now grown more familiar to me and especially while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword as i may call it but the horror i had at the place and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another abated my malice well at length i found a place in the side of the hill where i was satisfied i might securely wait till i saw any of the boats coming and might then even before they would be ready to come on shore convey myself unseen into thickets of trees in one of which there was an hollow large enough to conceal me entirely and where i might sit and observe all their bloody doings and take my full aim at their heads when they were so close together as that it would be next to impossible that i should miss my shoot or that i could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shoot in this place then i resolved to fix my design and accordingly i prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling piece the two muskets i loaded with a brace of slugs each and four or five smaller bullets about the size of pistol bullets and the fowling piece i loaded with near an handful of swan shot of the largest size i also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each and in this posture well provided with ammunition for a second and third charge i prepared myself for my expedition after i had thus laid the scheme for my design and in my imagination put it in practice i continually made my tour every morning up to the top of the hill which was from my castle as i called it about three miles or more to see if i could observe any boats upon the sea coming near the island or standing over towards it but i began to tire of this hard duty after i had for two or three months constantly kept my watch but came always back without any discovery there having not in all that time been the least appearance not only on or near the shore but not on the whole ocean so far as my eyes or glasses could reach every way as long as i kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out so long also i kept up the vigour of my design and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an offence which i had not at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts any further than my passions were at first fired by the horror i conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that country who it seems had been suffered by providence in his wise disposition of the world to have no other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions and consequently were left and perhaps had been for some ages to act such horrid things and receive such dreadful customs as nothing but nature entirely abandoned of heaven and actuated by some hellish degeneracy could have run them into but now when as i have said i began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which i had made so long and so far every morning in vain so my opinion of the action itself began to alter and i began with cooler and calmer thoughts to consider what it was i was going to engage in what authority or call i had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals whom heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on and to be as it were the executioners of his judgments upon one another also how far these people were offenders against me and what right i had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another i debated this very often with myself thus how do i know what god himself judges in this particular case it is certain these people do not commit this as a crime it is not against their own consciences reproving or their light reproaching them they do not know it to be an offence and then commit it in defiance of divine justice as we do in almost all the sins we commit they think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do to kill an ox nor to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton when i had considered this a little it followed necessarily that i was certainly in the wrong in it that these people were not murderers in the sense that i had before condemned them in my thoughts any more than those christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle or more frequently upon many occasions put whole troops of men to the sword without giving quarter though they threw down their arms and submitted in the next place it occurred to me that albeit the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman yet it was really nothing to me these people had done me no injury that if they attempted me or i saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to fall upon them something might be said for it but that i was yet out of their power and they had really no knowledge of me and consequently no design upon me and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them that this would justify the conduct of the spaniards in all their barbarities practised in america where they destroyed millions of these people who however they were idolaters and barbarians and had several bloody and barbarous rites in these customs such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols were yet as to the spaniards very innocent people and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation even by the spaniards themselves at this time and by all other christian nations of europe as a mere butchery a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty unjustifiable either to god or man and such as for which the very name of a spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity or of christian compassion as if the kingdom of spain were particularly eminent for the product of a race of men who were without principles of tenderness or the common bowels of pity to the miserable which is reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in the mind these considerations really put me to a pause and to a kind of a full stop and i began by little and little to be off of my design and to conclude i had taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to attack the savages that it was not my business to meddle with them unless they first attacked me and this it was my business if possible to prevent but that if i were discovered and attacked then i knew my duty on the other hand i argued with myself that this really was the way not to deliver myself but entirely to ruin and destroy myself for unless i was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at that time but that should ever come on shore afterwards if but one of them escaped to tell their country people what had happened they would come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows and i should only bring upon myself a certain destruction which at present i had no manner of occasion for upon the whole i concluded that neither in principles nor in policy i ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair that my business was by all possible means to conceal myself from them and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island i mean of human shape religion joined in with this prudential and i was convinced now many ways that i was perfectly out of my duty when i was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures i mean innocent as to me as to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another i had nothing to do with them they were national punishments to make a just retribution for national offences and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner by such ways as best please god this appeared so clear to me now that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that i had not been suffered to do a thing which i now saw so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if i had committed it and i gave most humble thanks on my knees to god that had thus delivered me from blood guiltiness beseeching him to grant me the protection of his providence that i might not fall into the hands of barbarians or that i might not lay my hands upon them unless i had a more clear call from heaven to do it in defence of my own life in this disposition i continued for near a year after this and so far was i from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches that in all that time i never once went up the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight or to know whether any of them had been on shore there or not that i might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them or be provoked by any advantage which might present itself to fall upon them only this i did i went and removed my boat which i had on the other side of the island and carried it down to the east end of the whole island where i ran it into a little cove which i found under some high rocks and where i knew by reason of the currents the savages durst not at least would not come with their boats upon any account whatsoever with my boat i carried away every thing that i had left there belonging to her though not necessary for the bare going thither viz a mast and sail which i had made for her and a thing like an anchor but indeed which could not be called either anchor or grappling however it was the best i could make of its kind all these i removed that there might not be the least shadow of any discovery or any appearance of any boat or of any habitation upon the island besides this i kept myself as i said more retired than ever and seldom went from my cell other than upon my constant employment viz to milk my she goats and manage my little flock in the wood which as it was quite on the other part of the island was quite out of danger for certain it is that these savage people who sometimes haunted this island never came with any thoughts of finding any thing here and consequently never wandered off from the coast and i doubt not but they might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious as well as before and indeed i looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been if i had chopped upon them and been discovered before that when naked and unarmed except with one gun and that loaded often only with small shot i walked every where peeping and peering about the island to see what i could get what a surprise should i have been in if when i discovered the print of a man s foot i had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages and found them pursuing me and by the swiftness of their running no possibility of my escaping them the thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me and distressed my mind so much that i could not soon recover it to think what i should have done and how i not only should not have been able to resist them but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what i might have done much less what now after so much consideration and preparation i might be able to do indeed after serious thinking of these things i would be very melancholy and sometimes it would last a great while but i resolved it at last all into thankfulness to that providence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers and had kept me from those mischiefs which i could no way have been the agent in delivering myself from because i had not the least notion of any such thing depending or the least supposition of its being possible this renewed a contemplation which often had come to my thoughts in former time when first i began to see the merciful dispositions of heaven in the dangers we run through in this life how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it how when we are in a quandary as we call it a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that way a secret hint shall direct us this way when we intended to go another way nay when sense our own inclination and perhaps business has called to go the other way yet a strange impression upon the mind from we know not what springs and by we know not what power shall over rule us to go this way and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that way which we would have gone and even to our imagination ought to have gone we should have been ruined and lost upon these and many like reflections i afterwards made it a certain rule with me that whenever i found those secret hints or pressings of my mind to doing or not doing any thing that presented or to going this way or that way i never failed to obey the secret dictate though i new no other reason for it than that such a pressure or such an hint hung upon my mind i could give many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island besides many occasions which it is very likely i might have taken notice of if i had seen with the same eyes then that i saw with now but tis never too late to be wise and i cannot but advise all considering men whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine or even though not so extraordinary not to slight such secret intimations of providence let them come from what invisible intelligence they will that i shall not discuss and perhaps cannot account for but certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits and the secret communication between those embodied and those unembodied and such a proof as can never be withstood of which i shall have occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place i believe the reader of this will not think it strange if i confess that these anxieties these constant dangers i lived in and the concern that was now upon me put an end to all invention and to all the contrivances that i had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences i had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food i cared not to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood now for fear the noise i should make should be heard much less would i fire a gun for the same reason and above all i was very uneasy at making any fire lest the smoke which is visible at a great distance in the day should betray me and for this reason i removed that part of my business which required fire such as burning of pots and pipes c into my new apartment in the wood where after i had been some time i found to my unspeakable consolation a mere natural cave in the earth which went in a vast way and where i dare say no savage had he been at the mouth of it would be so hardy as to venture in nor indeed would any man else but one who like me wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat the mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock where by mere accident i would say if i did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to providence i was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal and before i go on i must observe the reason of my making this charcoal which was thus i was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation as i said before and yet i could not live there without baking my bread cooking my meat c so i contrived to burn some wood here as i had seen done in england under turf till it became chark or dry coal and then putting the fire out i preserved the coal to carry home and perform the other services which fire was wanting for at home without danger or smoke but this by the by while i was cutting down some wood here i perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or underwood there was a kind of hollow place i was curious to look into it and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it i found it was pretty large that is to say sufficient for me to stand upright in it and perhaps another with me but i must confess to you i made more haste out than i did in when looking further into the place which was perfectly dark i saw two broad shining eyes of some creature whether devil or man i knew not which twinkled like two stars the dim light from the cave s mouth shining directly in and making the reflection however after some pause i recovered myself and began to call myself a thousand fools and tell myself that he that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone and that i durst to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself upon this plucking up my courage i took up a large firebrand and in i rushed again with the stick flaming in my hand i had not gone three steps in but i was almost as much frightened as i was before for i heard a very loud sigh like that of a man in some pain and it was followed by a broken noise as if of words half expressed and then a deep sigh again i stepped back and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat and if i had had an hat on my head i will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off but still plucking up my spirits as well as i could and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power and presence of god was every where and was able to protect me upon this i stepped forward again and by the light of the firebrand holding it up a little over my head i saw lying on the ground a most monstrous frightful old he goat just making his will as we say gasping for life and dying indeed of a mere old age i stirred him a little to see if i could get him out and he essayed to get up but was not able to raise himself and i thought with myself he might even lie there for if he had frightened me so he would certainly fright any of the savages if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him i was now recovered from my surprise and began to look round me when i found the cave was but very small that is to say it might be about twelve feet over but in no manner of shape either round or square no hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere nature i observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in farther but so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to get into it and whither it went i knew not so having no candle i gave it over for some time but resolved to come again the next day provided with candles and a tinder box which i had made of the lock of one of the muskets with some wildfire in the pan accordingly the next day i came provided with six large candles of my own making for i made very good candles now of goats tallow and going into this low place i was obliged to creep upon all fours as i have said almost ten yards which by the way i thought was a venture bold enough considering that i knew not how far it might go or what was beyond it when i was got through the streight i found the roof rose higher up i believe near twenty feet but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island i dare say as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave the walls reflected an hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles what it was in the rock whether diamonds or any other precious stones or gold which i rather supposed it to be i knew not the place i was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind as could be expected though perfectly dark the floor was dry and level and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it so that there was no nauseous creature to be seen neither was there any damp or wet on the sides of the roof the only difficulty in it was the entrance which however as it was a place of security and such a retreat as i wanted i thought that was a convenience so that i was really rejoiced at the discovery and resolved without any delay to bring some of those things which i was most anxious about to this place particularly i resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder and all my spare arms viz two fowling pieces for i had three in all and three muskets for of them i had eight in all so i kept at my castle only five which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my utmost fence and were ready also to take out upon any expedition upon this occasion of removing my ammunition i was obliged to open the barrel of powder which i took up out of the sea and which had been wet and i found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side which caking and growing hard had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell so that i had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask and this was an agreeable discovery to me at that time so i carried all away thither never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle for fear of a surprise of any kind i also carried thither all the lead i had left for bullets i fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks where none could come at them for i persuaded myself while i was here if five hundred savages were to hunt me they could never find me out or if they did they would not venture to attack me here the old goat which i found expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after i made this discovery and i found it much easier to dig a great hole there and throw him in and cover him with earth than to drag him out so i interred him there to prevent offence to my nose i was now in my twenty third year of residence in this island and was so naturalized to the place and to the manner of living that could i have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to disturb me i could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there even to the last moment till i had laid me down and died like the old goat in the cave i had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before as first i had taught my pol as i noted before to speak and he did it so familiarly and talked so articulately and plain that it was very pleasant to me and he lived with me no less than six and twenty years how long he might live afterwards i knew not though i know they have a notion in the brasils that they live an hundred years perhaps some of my polls may be alive there still calling after poor robin crusoe to this day i wish no englishman the ill luck to come there and hear them but if he did he would certainly believe it was the devil my dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time and then died of mere old age as for my cats they multiplied as i have observed to that degree that i was obliged to shoot several of them at first to keep them from devouring me and all i had but at length when the two old ones i brought with me were gone and after some time continually driving them from me and letting them have no provision with me they all ran wild into the woods except two or three favourites which i kept tame and whose young when they had any i always drowned and these were part of my family besides these i always kept two or three household kids about me which i taught to feed out of my hand and i had also more parrots which talked pretty well and would all call robin crusoe but none like my first nor indeed did i take the pains with any of them that i had done with him i had also several tame sea fowls whose names i know not which i caught upon the shore and cut their wings and the little stakes which i had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick grove these fowls all lived among these low trees and bred there which was very agreeable to me so that as i said above i began to be very well contented with the life i led if it might but have been secured from the dread of savages but it was otherwise directed and it might not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to make this just observation from it viz how frequently in the course of our lives the evil which in itself we seek most to shun and which when we are fallen into is the most dreadful to us is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into i could give many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island it was now the mouth of december as i said above in my twenty third year and this being the southern solstice for winter i cannot call it was the particular time of my harvest and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields when going out pretty early in the morning even before it was thorough daylight i was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore at a distance from me of about two miles towards the end of the island where i had observed some savages had been as before but not on the other side but to my great affliction it was on my side of the island i was indeed terribly surprised at the sight and stopped short within my grove not daring to go out lest i might be surprised and yet i had no more peace within from the apprehensions i had that if these savages in rambling over the island should find my corn standing or cut or any of my works and improvements they would immediately conclude that there were people in the place and would then never give over till they found me out in this extremity i went back directly to my castle pulled up the ladder after me having made all things without look as wild and natural as i could then i prepared myself within putting myself in a posture of defence i loaded all my cannon as i called them that is to say my muskets which were mounted upon my new fortification and all my pistols and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp not forgetting seriously to recommend myself to the divine protection and earnestly to pray to god to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians and in this posture i continued about two hours but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad for i had no spies to send out after sitting awhile longer and musing what i should do in this case i was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill where there was a flat place as i observed before and then pulling the ladder up after me i set it up again and mounted to the top of the hill and pulling out my perspective glass which i had taken on purpose i laid me down flat on my belly on the ground and began to look for the place i presently found there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they had made not to warm them for they had no need of that the weather being extreme hot but as i supposed to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them whether alive or dead i could not know they had two canoes with them which they had haled up upon the shore and as it was then tide of ebb they seemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go away again it is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into especially seeing them come on my side the island and so near me too but when i observed their coming must be always with the current of the ebb i began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind being satisfied that i might go abroad with safety all the time of tide of flood if they were not on shore before and having made this observation i went abroad about my harvest work with the more composure as i expected so it proved for as soon as the tide made to the westward i saw them all take boat and row or paddle as we call it all away i should have observed that for an hour and more before they went off they went to dancing and i could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glasses i could only perceive by my nicest observation that they were stark naked and had not the least covering upon them but whether they were men or women that i could not distinguish as soon as i saw them shipped and gone i took two guns upon my shoulders and two pistols at my girdle and my great sword by my side without a scabbard and with all the speed i was able to make i went away to the hill where i had discovered the first appearance of all as soon as i got thither which was not less than two hours for i could not go apace being so loaded with arms as i was i perceived there had been three canoes more of savages on that place and looking out further i saw they were all at sea together making over for the main this was a dreadful sight to me especially when going down to the shore i could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it viz the blood the bones and part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport i was so filled with indignation at the sight that i began now to premeditate the destruction of the next that i saw there let them be who or how many soever it seemed evident to me that the visits which they thus made to this island were not very frequent for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there again that is to say i never saw them or any footsteps or signals of them in all that time for as to the rainy seasons then they are sure not to come abroad at least not so far yet all this while i lived uncomfortably by reason of the constant apprehensions i was in of their coming upon me by surprise from whence i observe that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering especially if there is no room to shake off that expectation or those apprehensions during all this time i was in the murdering humour and took up most of my hours which should have been better employed in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next time i should see them especially if they should he divided as they were the last time into two parties nor did i consider at all that if i killed one party suppose ten or a dozen i was still the next day or week or mouth to kill another and so another even ad infinitum till i should be at length no less a murderer than they were in being men eaters and perhaps much mere so i spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind expecting that i should one day or other fall into the hands of those merciless creatures if i did at any time venture abroad it was not without looking round me with the greatest care and caution imaginable and now i found to my great comfort how happy it was that i had provided a tame flock or herd of goats for i durst not upon any account fire my gun especially near that side of the island where they usually came lest i should alarm the savages and if they had fled from me now i was sure to have them come back again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days and then i knew what to expect however i wore out a year and three months more before i ever saw any more of the savages and then i found them again as i shall soon observe it is true they might have been there once or twice but either they made no stay or at least i did not hear them but in the month of may as near as i could calculate and in my four and twentieth year i had a very strange encounter with them of which in its place the perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months interval was very great i slept unquiet dreamed always frightful dreams and often started out of my sleep in the night in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind in the night i dreamed often of killing the savages and the reasons why i might justify the doing of it but to wave all this for awhile it was in the middle of may on the sixteenth day i think as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon for i marked all upon the post still i say it was on the sixteenth of may that it blew a great storm of wind all day with a great deal of lightning and thunder and a very foul night was after it i know not what was the particular occasion of it but as i was reading in the bible and taken up with serious thoughts about my present condition i was surprised with the noise of a gun as i thought fired at sea this was to be sure a surprise of a quite different nature from any i had met with before for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind i started up in the greatest haste imaginable and in a trice clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the rock and pulled it after me and mounting it the second time got to the top of the hill that very moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second gun which accordingly in about half a moment i heard and by the sound knew that it was from that part of the sea where i was driven out with the current in my boat i immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress and that they had some comrade or some other ship in company and fired these guns for signals of distress and to obtain help i had this presence of mind at that minute as to think that though i could not help them it may be they might help me so i brought together all the dry wood i could get at hand and making a good handsome pile i set it on fire upon the hill the wood was dry and blazed freely and though the wind blew very hard yet it burnt fairly out so that i was certain if there was any such thing as a ship they must need see it and no doubt they did for as soon as ever my fire blazed up i heard another gun and after that several others all from the same quarter i plied my fire all night long till day broke and when it was broad day and the air cleared up i saw something at a great distance at sea full east of the island whether a sail or an hull i could not distinguish no not with my glasses the distance was so great and the weather still something hazy also at least it was so out at sea i looked frequently at it all that day and soon perceived that it did not move so i presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor and being eager you may be sure to be satisfied i took my gun in my hand and ran towards the south east side of the island to the rocks where i had been formerly carried away with the current and getting up there the weather by this time being perfectly clear i could plainly see to my great sorrow the wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which i found when i was out in my boat and which rocks as they checked the violence of the stream and made a kind of counter stream or eddy were the occasion of my recovering then from the most desperate hopeless condition that ever i had been in all my life thus what is one man s safety is another man s destruction for it seems these men whoever they were being out of their knowledge and the rocks being wholly under water had been driven upon them in the night the wind blowing hard at e and e n e had they seen the island as i must necessarily suppose they did not they must as i thought have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat but the firing of their guns for help especially when they saw as i imagined my fire filled me with many thoughts first i imagined that upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their boat and have endeavoured to make the shore but that the sea going very high they might have been cast away other times i imagined that they might have lost their boat before as might be the case many ways as particularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship which many times obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands other times i imagined they had some other ship or ships in company who upon the signals of distress they had made had taken them up and carried them off other whiles i fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat and being hurried away by the current that i had been formerly in were carried out into the great ocean where there was nothing but misery and perishing and that perhaps they might by this time think of starving and of being in a condition to eat one another all these were but conjectures at best so in the condition i was in i could do no more than look upon the misery of the poor men and pity them which had still this good effect on my side that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to god who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition and that of two ships companies who were now cast away upon this part of the world not one life should be spared but mine i learnt here again to observe that it is very rare that the providence of god casts us into any condition of life so low or any misery so great but we may see something or other to be thankful for and may see others in worse circumstances than our own such certainly was the case of these men of whom i could not so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in company and this was but mere possibility indeed for i saw not the least signal or appearance of any such thing i cannot explain by any possible energy of words what a strange longing or hankering of desire i felt in my soul upon this sight breaking out sometimes thus o that there had been but one or two nay but one soul saved out of the ship to have escaped to me that i might but have had one companion one fellow creature to have spoken to me and to have conversed with in all the time of my solitary life i never felt so earnest so strong a desire after the society of my fellow creatures or so deep a regret at want of it there are some secret moving springs in the affections which when they are set a going by some object in view or be it some object though not in view yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination that motion carries out the soul by its impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the object that the absence of it is insupportable such were these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved o that it had been but one i believe i repeated the words o that it had been but one a thousand times and my desires were so moved by it that when i spoke the words my hands would clinch together and my fingers press the palms of my hands that if i had had any soft thing in my hand it would have crushed it involuntarily and my teeth in my head would strike together and set against one another so strong that for some time i could not part them again let the naturalists explain these things and the reason and manner of them all i can say of them is to describe the fact which was ever surprising to me when i found it though i knew not from what it should proceed it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes and of strong ideas formed in my mind realizing the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow christians would have been to me but it was not to be either their fate or mine or both forbad it for till the last year of my being on this island i never knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no and had only the affliction some days after to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck he had on no clothes but a seaman s waistcoat a pair of open kneed linen drawers and a blue linen shirt but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of he had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe the last was to me of ten times more value than the first it was now calm and i had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this wreck not doubting but i might find something on board that might be useful to me but that did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board whose life i might not only save but might by saving that life comfort my own to the last degree and this thought clung so to my heart that i could not be quiet night nor day but i must venture out in my boat on board this wreck and committing the rest to god s providence i thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted that it must come from some invisible direction and that i should be wanting to myself if i did not go under the power of this impression i hastened back to my castle prepared every thing for my voyage took a quantity of bread a great pot for fresh water a compass to steer by a bottle of rum for i had still a great deal of that left a basket full of raisins and thus loading myself with every thing necessary i went down to my boat got the water out of her and got her afloat loaded all my cargo in her and then went home again for more my second cargo was a great bag full of rice the umbrella to set up over my head for shade another large pot full of lush water and about two dozen of my small loaves or barley cakes more than before with a bottle of goat s milk and a cheese all which with great labour and sweat i brought to my boat and praying to god to direct my voyage i put out and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore i came at last to the utmost point of the island on that side viz n e and now i was to launch out into the ocean and either to venture or not to venture i looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance and which were very terrible to me from the remembrance of the hazard i had been in before and my heart began to fail me for i foresaw that if i was driven into either of those currents i should be carried a vast way out to sea and perhaps out of my reach or sight of the island again and that then as my boat was but small if any little gale of wind should rise i should be inevitably lost these thoughts so oppressed my mind that i began to give over my enterprise and having haled my boat into a little creek on the shore i stepped out and sat me down upon a little spot of rising ground very pensive and anxious between fear and desire about my voyage when as i was musing i could perceive that the tide was turned and the flood came on upon which my going was for so many hours impracticable upon this it presently occurred to me that i should go up to the highest piece of ground i could find and observe if i could how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the flood came in that i might judge whether if i was driven one way out i might not expect to be driven another way home with the same rapidness of the currents this thought was no sooner in my head but i cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways and from whence i had a clear view of the currents or sets of the tide and which way i was to guide myself in my return here i found that as the current of the ebb set out close by the south point of the island so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side and that i had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the island in my return and i should do well enough encouraged with this observation i resolved the next morning to set out with the first of the tide and reposing myself for that night in the canoe under the great watch coat i mentioned i launched out i made first a little out to sea full north till i began to feel the benefit of the current which sat eastward and which carried me at a great rate and yet did not so hurry me as the southern side current had done before and so as to take from me all government of the boat but having a strong steerage with my paddle i went i say at a great rate directly for the wreck and in less than two hours i came up to it it was a dismal sight to took at the ship which by its building was spanish stuck fast jambed in between two rocks all the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea and as her forecastle which stuck in the rocks had run on with great violence her main mast and fore mast were brought by the board that is to say broken short off but her boltsprit was sound and the head and bow appeared firm when i came close to her a dog appeared upon her which seeing me coming yelped and cried and as soon as i called him jumped into the sea to come to me and i took him into the boat but found him almost dead for hunger and thirst i gave him a cake of my bread and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow i then gave the poor creature some fresh water with which if i would have let him he would have burst himself after this i went on board the first sight i met with was two men drowned in the cook room or forecastle of the ship with their arms fast about one another i concluded as is indeed probable that when the ship struck it being in a storm the sea broke so high and so continually over her that the men were not able to bear it and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the water as much as if they had been under water besides the dog there was nothing left in the ship that had life nor any goods that i could see but what were spoiled by the water there were some casks of liquor whether wine or brandy i knew not which lay lower in the hold and which the water being ebbed out i could see but they were too big to meddle with i saw several chests which i believed belonged to some of the seamen and i got two of them into the boat without examining what was in them had the stern of the ship been fixed and the fore part broken off i am persuaded i might have made a good voyage for by what i found in these two chests i had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board and if i may guess by the course she steered she must have been bound from the buenos ayres or the rio de la plata in the south part of america beyond the brasils to the havanna in the gulf of mexico and so perhaps to spain she had no doubt a great treasure in her but of no use at that time to any body and what became of the rest of her people i then knew not i found besides these chests a little cask full of liquor of about twenty gallons which i got into my boat with much difficulty there were several muskets in a cabin and a great powder horn with about four pounds of powder in it as for the muskets i had no occasion for them so i left them but took the powder horn i took a fire shovel and tongs which i wanted extremely as also two little brass kettles a copper pot to make chocolate and a gridiron and with this cargo and the dog i came away the tide beginning to make home again and the same evening about an hour within night i reached the island again weary and fatigued to the last degree i reposed that night in the boat and in the morning i resolved to harbour what i had gotten in my new cave not to carry it home to my castle after refreshing myself i got all my cargo on shore and began to examine the particulars the cask of liquor i found to be a kind of rum but not such as we had at the brasils and in a word not at all good but when i came to open the chests i found several things which i wanted for example i found in one a fine case of bottles of an extraordinary kind and filled with cordial waters fine and very good the bottles held about three pints each and were tipped with silver i found two pots of very good succades or sweetmeats so fastened also on the top that the salt water had not hurt them and two more of the same which the water had spoiled i found some very good shirts which were very welcome to me and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths the former were also very welcome being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day besides this when i came to the till in the chests i found there three great bags of pieces of eight which held about eleven hundred pieces in all and in one of them wrapt up in a paper six doubloons of gold and some small bars or wedges of gold i suppose they might all weigh near a pound the other chest i found had some clothes in it but of little value but by the circumstances it must have belonged to the gunner s mate as there was no powder in it but about two pounds of glazed powder in the three flasks kept i suppose for charging their fowling pieces on occasion upon the whole i got very little by this voyage that was of much use to me for as to the money i had no manner of occasion for it it was to me as the dirt under my feet and i would have given it all for three or four pair of english shoes and stockings which were things i greatly wanted but had not had on my feet now for many years i had indeed got two pair of shoes now which i took off the feet of the two drowned men whom i saw in the wreck and i found two pair more in one of the chests which were very welcome to me but they were not like our english shoes either for case or service being rather what we call pumps than shoes i found in the seaman s chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals but no gold i suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other which seemed to belong to some officer well however i lugged the money home to my cave and laid it up as i had done that before which i brought from our own ship but it was great pity as i said that the other part of the ship had not come to my share for i am satisfied i might have loaded my canoe several times over with money which if i had ever escaped to england would have lain here safe enough till i might have come again and fetched it having now brought all my things on shore and secured them i went back to my boat and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour where i laid her up and made the best of my way to my old habitation where i found every thing safe and quiet so i began to repose myself live after my old fashion and take care of my family affairs and for awhile i lived easy enough only that i was more vigilant than i used to be looked out oftener and did not go abroad so much and if at any time i did stir with any freedom it was always to the east part of the island where i was pretty well satisfied the savages never came and where i could go without so many precautions and such a load of arms and ammunition as i always carried with me if i went the other way i lived in this condition near two years more but my unlucky head that was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable was all these two years filled with projects and designs how if it were possible i might get away from this island for sometimes i was for making another voyage to the wreck though my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage sometimes for a ramble one way sometimes another and i believe verity if i had had the boat that i went from sallee in i should have ventured to sea bound any where i knew not whither i have been in all my circumstances a memento to those who are touched with that general plague of mankind whence for aught i know one half of their miseries flow i mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein god and nature hath placed them for not to look back upon my primitive condition and the excellent advice of my father the opposition to which was as i may call it my original sin my subsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the means of my coming into this miserable condition for had that providence which so happily had seated me at the brasils as a planter blessed me with confined desires and could i have been contented to have gone on gradually i might have been by this time i mean in the time of my being on this island one of the most considerable planters in the brasils nay i am persuaded that by the improvements i had made in that little time i lived there and the increase i should probably have made if i had stayed i might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores and what business had i to leave a settled fortune well stocked plantation improving and increasing to turn supercargo to guinea to fetch negroes when patience and time would have so increased our stock at home that we could have bought them at our own doors from those whose business it was to fetch them and though it had cost us something more yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard but as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise of more years or of the dear bought experience of time and so it was with me now and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper that i could not satisfy myself in my station but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from this place and that i may with the greater pleasure to the reader bring on the remaining part of my story it may not be improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape and how and upon what foundation i acted i am now to be supposed to be retired into my castle after my late voyage to the wreck my frigate laid up and secured under water as usual and my condition restored to what it was before i had more wealth indeed than i had before but was not at all the richer for i had no more use for it than the indians of peru had before the spaniards came thither it was one of the nights in the rainy season in march the four and twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitariness i was lying in my bed or hammock awake and very well in health had no pain no distemper no uneasiness of body no nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary but could by no means close my eyes that is so as to sleep no not a wink all night long otherwise than as follows it is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain the memory in this night s time i ran over the whole history of my life in miniature or by abridgment as i may call it to my coming to this island and also of that part of my life since i came to this island in my reflections upon the state of my case since i came on shore on this island i was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation here to that course of anxiety fear and care which i had lived in ever since i had seen the print of a foot in the sand not that i did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the while and might have been several hundreds of them at times on the shore there but as i had never known it and was incapable of any apprehensions about it my satisfaction was perfect though my danger was the same and i was as happy in not knowing my danger as if i had never really been exposed to it this furnished my thoughts with many very profitable reflections and particularly this one how infinitely good that providence is which has settled in its government of mankind such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers the sight of which if discovered to him would distract his mind and sink his spirits he is kept serene and calm by having the events of things hid from his eyes and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him after these thoughts had for some time entertained me i came to reflect seriously upon the real danger i had been in for so many years in this very island and how i had walked about in the greatest security and with all possible tranquillity even perhaps when nothing but a brow on a hill a great tree or the casual approach of night had been between me and the worst kind of destruction viz that of falling into the hands of cannibals and savages who would have seized on me with the same view as i did of a goat or a turtle and have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me than i did of a pigeon or a curlieu i would unjustly slander my self if i should say i was not sincerely thankful to my great preserver to whose singular protection i acknowledged with great humility that all these unknown deliverances were due and without which i must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands when these thoughts were over my head was for some time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures i mean the savages and how it came to pass in the world that the wise governour of all things should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity nay to something so much below even brutality it self as to devour its own kind but as this ended in some at that time fruitless speculations it occurred to me to enquire what part of the world these wretches lived in how far off the coast was from whence they came what they ventured over so far from home for what kind of boats they had and why i might not order my self and my business so that i might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me i never so much as troubled my self to consider what i should do with my self when i came thither what would become of me if i fell into the hands of the savages or how i should escape from them if they attempted me no nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast and not be attempted by some or other of them without any possibility of delivering my self and if i should not fall into their hands what i should do for provision or whither i should bend my course none of these thoughts i say so much as came in my way but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the main land i looked back upon my present condition as the most miserable that could possibly be that i was not able to throw myself into any thing but death that could be called worse that if i reached the shore of the main i might perhaps meet with relief or i might coast along as i did on the shore of africa till i came to some inhabited country and where i might find some relief and after all perhaps i might fall in with some christian ship that might take me in and if the worst came to the worst i could but die which would put an end to all these miseries at once pray note all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind an impatient temper made as it were desperate by the long continuance of my troubles and the disappointments i had met in the wreck i had been on board of and where i had been so near the obtaining of what i so earnestly longed for viz somebody to speak to and to learn some knowledge from of the place where i was and of the probable means of my deliverance i say i was agitated wholly by these thoughts all my calm of mind in my resignation to providence and waiting the issue of the dispositions of heaven seemed to be suspended and i had as it were no power to turn my thoughts to any thing but the project of a voyage to the main which came upon me with such force and such an impetuosity of desire that it was not to be resisted when this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment and my pulse beat as high as if i had been in a fever merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it nature as if i had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it threw me into a sound sleep one would have thought i should have dreamed of it but i did not nor of any thing relating to it but i dreamed that as i was going out in the morning as usual from my castle i saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to land and that they brought with them another savage whom they were going to kill in order to eat him when on a sudden the savage that they were going to kill jumped away and ran for his life then i thought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove before my fortification to hide himself and that i seeing him alone and not perceiving that the others sought him that way shewed myself to him and smiling upon him encouraged him that he kneeled down to me seeming to pray me to assist him upon which i shewed my ladder made him go up it and carried him into my cave and he became my servant and that as soon as i had got this man i said to myself now i may certainly venture to the main land for this fellow will serve me as a pilot and will tell me what to do and whither to go for provisions and whither not to go for fear of being devoured what places to venture into and what to escape i waked with this thought and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream that the disappointments which i felt upon coming to myself and finding it was no more than a dream were equally extravagant the other way and threw me into a very great dejection of spirit upon this however i made this conclusion that my only way to go about an attempt for an escape was if possible to get a savage in my possession and if possible it should be one of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten and should bring hither to kill but these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty that it was impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them and killing them all and this was not only a very desperate attempt and might miscarry but on the other hand i had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to me and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood though it was for my deliverance i need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this they being the same mentioned before but though i had other reasons to offer now viz that those men were enemies to my life and would devour me if they could that it was self preservation in the highest degree to deliver myself from this death of a life and was acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me and the like i say though these things argued for it yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me and such as i could by no means reconcile myself to a great while however at last after many secret disputes with myself and after great perplexities about it for all these arguments one way and another struggled in my head a long time the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest and i resolved if possible to get one of these savages into my bands cost what it would the next thing then was to contrive how to do it and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on but as i could pitch upon no probable means for it so i resolved to put myself upon the watch to see them when they came on shore and leave the rest to the event taking such measures as the opportunity should present let it be what it would with these resolutions in my thoughts i set myself upon the scout as often as possible and indeed so often till i was heartily tired of it for it was above a year and a half that i waited and for a great part of that time went out to the west end and to the south west corner of the island almost every day to see the canoes but none appeared this was very discouraging and began to trouble me much though i can t say that it did in this case as it had done some time before that viz wear off the edge of my desire to the thing but the longer it seemed to be delayed the more eager i was for it in a word i was not at first more careful to shun the sight of these savages and avoid being seen by them than i was now eager to be upon them besides i fancied myself able to manage one nay two or three savages if i had them so as to make them entirely slaves to me to do whatever i should direct them and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt it was a great while that i pleased myself with this affair but nothing still presented all my fancies and schemes came to nothing for no savages came near me for a great while about a year and a half after i had entertained these notions and by long musing had as it were resolved them all into nothing for want of an occasion to put them in execution i was surprised one morning early with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight the number of them broke all my measures for seeing so many and knowing that they always came four or six or sometimes more in a boat i could not tell what to think of it or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single handed so i lay still in my castle perplexed and discomforted however i put myself into all the same postures for an attack that i had formerly provided and was just ready for action if any thing had presented having waited a good while listening to hear if they made any noise at length being very impatient i set my guns at the foot of my ladder and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two stages as usual standing so however that my head did not appear above the hill so that they could not perceive me by any means here i observed by the help of my perspective glass that they were no less than thirty in number that they had a fire kindled and that they had had meat dressed how they cooked it that i knew not or what it was but they were all dancing in i know not how many barbarous gestures and figures their own way round the fire when i was thus looking on them i perceived by my perspective two miserable wretches dragged from the boats where it seems they were laid by and were now brought out for the slaughter i perceived one of them immediately fall being knocked down i suppose with a club or wooden sword for that was their way and two or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their cookery while the other victim was left standing by himself till they should be ready for him in that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty nature inspired him with hopes of life and he started away from them and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands directly towards me i mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation was i was dreadfully frighted that i must acknowledge when i perceived him to run my way and especially when as i thought i saw him pursued by the whole body and now i expected that part of my dream was coming to pass and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove but i could not depend by any means upon my dream for the rest of it viz that the other savages would not pursue him thither and find him there however i kept my station and my spirits began to recover when i found that there were not above three men that followed him and still more was i encouraged when i found that he out stript them exceedingly in running and gained ground of them so that if he could but hold it for half an hour i saw easily he would fairly get away from them all there was between them and my castle the creek which i mentioned often at the first part of my story when i landed my cargoes out of the ship and this i knew he must necessarily swim over or the poor wretch would be taken there but when the savage escaping came thither he made nothing of it though the tide was then up but plunging in swam through in about thirty strokes or thereabouts landed and ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness when the three pursuers came to the creek i found that two of them could swim but the third could not and that he standing on the other side looked at the other but went no farther and soon after went softly back again which as it happened was very well for him in the main i observed that the two who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the creek than the fellow was that fled from them it came now very warmly upon my thoughts and indeed irresistibly that now was my time to get a servant and perhaps a companion or assistant and that i was called plainly by providence to save this poor creature s life i immediately got down the ladders with all possible expedition fetched my two guns for they were both at the foot of the ladder as i observed above and getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill i crossed towards the sea and having a very short cut and all down hill clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued hallooing aloud to him that fled who looking back was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as at them but i beckoned with my hand to him to come back and in the meantime i slowly advanced towards the two that followed then rushing at once upon the foremost i knocked him down with the stock of my piece i was loath to fire because i would not have the rest hear though at that distance it would not have been easily heard and being out of sigh of the smoke too they would not have easily known what to make of it i having knocked this fellow down the other who pursued him stopped as if he had been frightened and i advanced apace towards him but as i came nearer i perceived presently he had a bow and arrow and was fitting it to shoot at me so i was then necessitated to shoot at him first which i did and killed him at the first shot the poor savage who fled but had stopped though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed as he thought yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece that he stood stock still and neither came forward nor went backward though he seemed rather inclined to fly still than to come on i hallooed again to him and made signs to come forward which he easily understood and came a little way then stopped again and then a little farther and stopped again and i could then perceive that he stood trembling as if he had been taken prisoner and had just been to be killed as his two enemies were i beckoned him again to come to me and gave him all the signs of encouragement that i could think of and he came nearer and nearer kneeling down every ten or twelve steps in token of acknowledgment for saving his life i smiled at him and looked pleasantly and beckoned to him to come still nearer at length he came close to me and then he kneeled down again kissed the ground and laid his head upon the ground and taking me by the foot set my foot upon his head this it seems was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever i took him up and made much of him and encouraged him all i could but there was more work to do yet for i perceived the savage whom i knocked down was not killed but stunned with the blow and began to come to himself so i pointed to him and showed him the savage that he was not dead upon this he spoke some words to me and though i could not understand them yet i thought they were pleasant to hear for they were the first sound of a man s voice that i had heard my own excepted for above five and twenty years but there was no time for such reflections now the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground and i perceived that my savage began to be afraid but when i saw that i presented my other piece at the man as if i would shoot him upon this my savage for so i call him now made a motion to me to lend him my sword which hung naked in a belt by my side so i did he no sooner had it but he runs to his enemy and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly no executioner in germany could have done it sooner or better which i thought very strange for one who i had reason to believe never saw a sword in his life before except their own wooden swords however it seems as i learnt afterwards they make their wooden swords so sharp so heavy and the wood is so hard that they will cut off heads even with them nay and arms and that at one blow too when he had done this he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph and brought me the sword again and with abundance of gestures which i did not understand laid it down with the head of the savage that he had killed just before me but that which astonished him most was to know how i had killed the other indian so far off so pointing to him he made signs to me to let him go to him so i bade him go as well as i could when he came to him he stood like one amazed looking at him turned him first on one side then on t other looked at the wound the bullet had made which it seems was just in his breast where it had made a hole and no great quantity of blood had followed but he had bled inwardly for he was quite dead then he took up his bow and arrows and came back so i turned to go away and beckoned him to follow me making signs to him that more might come after them upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with sand that they might not he seen by the rest if they followed and so i made signs again to him to do so he fell to work and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands big enough to bury the first in and then dragged him into it and covered him and did so also by the other i believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour then calling him away i carried him not to my castle but quite away to my cave on the farther part of the island so i did not let my dream come to pass in that part viz that he came into my grove for shelter here i gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat and a draught of water which i found he was indeed in great distress for by his running and having refreshed him i made signs for him to go lie down and sleep pointing to a place where i had laid a great parcel of rice straw and a blanket upon it which i used to sleep upon myself sometimes so the poor creature lay down and went to sleep he was a comely handsome fellow perfectly well made with straight long limbs not too large tall and well shaped and as i reckon about twenty six years of age he had a very good countenance not a fierce and surly aspect but seemed to have something very manly in his face and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an european in his countenance too especially when he smiled his hair was long and black not curled like wool his forehead very high and large and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes the colour of his skin was not quite black but very tawny and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny as the brasilians and virginians and other natives of america are but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour that had in it something very agreeable though not very easy to describe his face was round and plump his nose small not flat like the negroe s a very good mouth thin lips and his teeth fine well set and white as ivory after he had slumbered rather than slept about half an hour he waked again and comes out of the cave to me for i had been milking my goats which i had in the enclosure just by when he espied me he came running to me laying himself down again upon the ground with all the possible signs of an humble thankful disposition making many antic gestures to shew it at last he lays his head flat upon the ground close to my foot and sets my other foot upon his head as he had done before and after this made all the signs to me of subjection servitude and submission imaginable to let me know how much he would serve me as long as he lived i understood him in many things and let him know i was very well pleased with him in a little time i began to speak to him and teach him to speak to me and first i made him know his name should be friday which was the day i saved his life and i called him so for the memory of the time i likewise taught him to say master and then let him know that was to be my name i likewise taught him to say yes and no and to know the meaning of them i gave him some milk in an earthen pot and let him see me drink it before him and sop my bread in it and i gave him a cake of bread to do the like which he quickly complied with and made signs that it was very good for him i kept there with him all that night but as soon as it was day i beckoned him to come with me and let him know i would give him some clothes at which he seemed very glad for he was stark naked as we went by the place where he had buried the two men he pointed exactly to the spot and shewed me the marks that he had made to find them again making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat them at this i appeared very angry expressed my abhorrence of it made as if i would vomit at the thoughts of it and beckoned with my hand to him to come away which he did immediately with great submission i then led him up to the top of the hill to see if his enemies were gone and pulling out my glass i looked and saw plainly the place where they had been but no appearance of them or of their canoes so that it was plain that they were gone and had left their two comrades behind them without any search after them but i was not content with this discovery but having now more courage and consequently more curiosity i took my man friday with me giving him the sword in his hand with the bow and arrows at his back which i found he could use very dexterously making him carry one gun for me and i two for myself and away we marched to the place where these creatures had been for i had a mind now to get some further intelligence of them when i came to the place my very blood ran chill in my veins and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the spectacle indeed it was a dreadful sight at least it was so to me though friday made nothing of it the place was covered with human bones the ground dyed with the blood great pieces of flesh left here and there half eaten mangled and scorched and in short all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there after a victory over their enemies i saw three skulls five hands and the bones of three or four legs and feet and abundance of other parts of the bodies and friday by his signs made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon that three of them were eaten up and that he pointing to himself was the fourth that there had been a great battle between them and their next king whose subjects it seems he had been one of and that they had taken a great number of prisoners all which were carried to several places by those that had taken them in the flight in order to feast upon them as was done here by these wretches upon those they brought hither i caused friday to gather all the skulls bones flesh and whatever remained and lay them together on an heap and make a great fire upon it and burn them all to ashes i found friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh and was still a cannibal in his nature but i discovered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it and at the least appearance of it that he durst not discover it for i had by some means let him know that i would kill him if he offered it when we had done this we came back to our castle and there i fell to work for my man friday and first of all i gave him a pair of linen drawers which i had out of the poor gunner s chest i mentioned and which i found in the wreck and which with a little alteration fitted him very well then i made him a jerkin of goat s skin as well as my skill would allow and i was now grown a tolerable good tailor and i gave him a cap which i had made of a hare skin very convenient and fashionable enough and thus he was dressed for the present tolerably well and mighty well was he pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master it is true he went awkwardly in these things at first wearing the drawers was very awkward to him and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms but a little easing them where he complained they hurt him and using himself to them at length he took to them very well the next day after i came home to my hutch with him i began to consider where i should lodge him and that i might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself i made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortifications in the inside of the last and in the outside of the first and as there was a door or entrance there into my cave i made a formal framed door case and a door to it of boards and set it up in the passage a little within the entrance and causing the door to open on the inside i barred it up in the night taking in my ladders too so that friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall without making so much noise in getting over that it must needs awaken me for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles covering all my tent and leaning up to the side of the hill which was again laid cross with small sticks instead of laths and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw which was strong like reeds and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder i had placed a kind of trapdoor which if it had been attempted on the outside would not have opened at all but would have fallen down and made a great noise and as to weapons i took them all in to my side every night but i needed none of all this precaution for never man had a more faithful loving sincere servant than friday was to me without passions sullenness or designs perfectly obliging and engaging his very affections were tied to me like those of a child to a father and i dare say he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine upon any occasion whatsoever the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt and soon convinced me that i needed to use no precautions as to my safety on his account this frequently gave me occasion to observe and that with wonder that however it had pleased god in his providence and in the government of the works of his hands to take from so great a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers the same reason the same affections the same sentiments of kindness and obligation the same passions and resentments of wrongs the same sense of gratitude sincerity fidelity and all the capacities of doing good and receiving good that he has given to us and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these they are as ready nay more ready to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed than we are and this made me very melancholy sometimes in reflecting as the several occasions presented how mean a use we make of all these even though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction the spirit of god and by the knowledge of his word added to our understanding and why it has pleased god to hide the life saving knowledge from so many millions of souls who if i might judge by this poor savage would make a much better use of it than we did from hence i sometimes was led too far to invade the sovereignty of providence and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things that should hide that light from some and reveal it to others and yet expect a like duty from both but i shut it up and checked my thoughts with this conclusion first that we do not know by what light and law these should be condemned but that as god was necessarily and by the nature of his being infinitely holy and just so it could not be but that if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from himself it was on account of sinning against that light which as the scripture says was a law to themselves and by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just though the foundation was not discovered to us and secondly that still as we are all clay in the hand of the potter no vessel could say to him why hast thou formed me thus but to return to my new companion i was greatly delighted with him and made it my business to teach him every thing that was proper to make him useful handy and helpful but especially to make him speak and understand me when i spake and he was the aptest scholar that ever was and particularly was so merry so constantly diligent and so pleased when he could but understand me or make me understand him that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him and now my life began to be so easy that i began to say to myself that could i but have been safe from more savages i cared not if i was never to remove from the place while i lived after i had been two or three days returned to my castle i thought that in order to bring friday off from his horrid way of feeding and from the relish of a cannibal s stomach i ought to let him taste other flesh so i took him out with me one morning to the woods i went indeed intending to kill a kid out of my own flock and bring it home and dress it but as i was going i saw a she goat lying down in the shade and two young kids sitting by her i catched hold of friday hold said i stand still and made signs to him not to stir immediately i presented my piece shot and killed one of the kids the poor creature who had at a distance indeed seen me kill the savage his enemy but did not know or could imagine how it was done was sensibly surprised trembled and shook and looked so amazed that i thought he would have sunk down he did not see the kid i had shot at or perceive i had killed it but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded and as i found presently thought i was resolved to kill him for he came and kneeled down to me and embracing my knees said a great many things i did not understand but i could easily see that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him i soon found a way to convince him that i would do him no harm and taking him up by the hand laughed at him and pointing to the kid which i had killed beckoned to him to run and fetch it which he did and while he was wondering and looking to see how the creature was killed i loaded my gun again and by and by i saw a great fowl like a hawk sit upon a tree within shot so to let friday understand a little what i would do i called him to me again pointing at the fowl which was indeed a parrot though i thought it had been a hawk i say pointing to the parrot and to my gun and to the ground under the parrot to let him see i would make him fall i made him understand that i would shoot and kill that bird accordingly i fired and bid him look and immediately he saw the parrot fall he stood like one frighted again notwithstanding all that i had said to him and i found he was the more amazed because he did not see me put any thing into the gun but thought there must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing able to kill man beast bird or any thing near or far off for the astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear off for a long time and i believe if i would have let him he would have worshipped me and my gun as for the gun itself he would not so much as touch it for several days over but would speak to it and talk to it as if it had answered him when he was by himself which as i afterwards learnt of him was to desire it not to kill him well after his astonishment was a little over at this i pointed to him to run and fetch the bird i had shot which he did but staid some time for the parrot not being quite dead had fluttered a good way off from the place where she fell however he found her took her up and brought her to me and as i had perceived his ignorance about the gun before i took this advantage to charge the gun again and not let him see me do it that i might he ready for any other mark that might present but nothing more offered at that time so i brought home the kid and the same evening i took the skin off and cut it out as well as i could and having a pot for that purpose i boiled or stewed some of the flesh and made some very good broth after i had begun to eat some i gave some to my man who seemed very glad of it and liked it very well but that which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with it he made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat and putting a little into his own month he seemed to nauseate it and would spit and sputter at it washing his mouth with fresh water after it on the other hand i took some meat in my mouth without salt and i pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt as fast as he had done at the salt but it would not do he would never care for salt with meat or in his broth at least not a great while and then but a very little having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth i was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid this i did by hanging it before the fire in a string as i had seen many people do in england setting two poles up one on each side the fire and one cross on the top and tying the string to the cross stick letting the meat turn continually this friday admired very much but when he came to taste the flesh he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it that i could not but understand him and at last he told me he would never eat man s flesh any more which i was very glad to hear the next day i set him to work to beating some corn out and sifting it in the manner i used to do as i observed before and he soon understood how to do it as well as i especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was and that it was to make bread of for after that i let him see me make my bread and bake it too and in a little time friday was able to do all the work for me as well as i could do it myself i began now to consider that having two mouths to feed instead of one i must provide more ground for my harvest and plant a larger quantity of corn than i used to do so i marked out a larger piece of land and began the fence in the same manner as before in which friday not only worked very willingly and very hard but did it very cheerfully and i told him what it was for that it was for corn to make more bread because he was now with me and that i might have enough for him and myself too he appeared very sensible of that part and let me know that he thought i had much more labour upon me on his account than i had for myself and that he would work the harder for me if i would tell him what to do this was the pleasantest year of all the life i led in this place friday began to talk pretty well and understand the names of almost every thing i had occasion to call for and of every place i had to send him to and talk a great deal to me so that in short i began now to have some use for my tongue again which indeed i had very little occasion for before that is to say about speech besides the pleasure of talking to him i had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself his simple unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day and i began really to love the creature and on his side i believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love any thing before i had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his own country again and having learnt him english so well that he could answer me almost any questions i asked him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle at which he smiled and said yes yes we always fight the better that is he meant always get the better in fight and so we began the following discourse you always fight the better said i how came you to be taken prisoner then friday friday my nation beat much for all that master how beat if your nation beat them how came you to be taken friday they more than my nation in the place where me was they take one two three and me my nation over beat them in the yonder place where me no was there my nation take one two great thousand master but why did not your side recover you from the hands of your enemies then friday they run one two three and me and make go in the canoe my nation have no canoe that time master well friday and what does your nation do with the men they take do they carry them away and eat them as these did friday yes my nation eat mans too eat all up master where do they carry them friday go to other place where they think master do they come hither friday yes yes they come hither come other else place master have you been here with them friday yes i been here points to the n w side of the island which it seems was their side by this i understood that my man friday had formerly been among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island on the said man eating occasions that he was now brought for and some time after when i took the courage to carry him to that side being the same i formerly mentioned he presently knew the place and told me he was there once when they ate up twenty men two women and one child he could not tell twenty in english but he numbered them by laying so many stones in a row and pointing to me to tell them over i have told this passage because it introduces what follows that after i had had this discourse with him i asked him how far it was from our island to the shore and whether the canoes were not often lost he told me there was no danger no canoes ever lost but that after a little way out to sea there was a current and a wind always one way in the morning the other in the afternoon this i understand to be no more than the sets of the tide as going out or coming in but i afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river oroonoque in the mouth of which river as i thought afterwards our island lay and that this land which i perceived to the w and n w was the great island trinidad on the north point of the mouth of the river i asked friday a thousand questions about the country the inhabitants the sea the coast and what nations were near he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable i asked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people but could get no other name than caribs from whence i easily understood that these were the caribees which our maps place on that part of america which reaches from the mouth of the river oroonoque to guinea and onwards to st martha he told me that up a great way beyond the moon that was beyond the setting of the moon which must be w from their country there dwelt white bearded men like me and pointed to my great whiskers which i mentioned before and that they had killed much mans that was his word by which i understood he meant the spaniards whose cruelties in america had been spread over the whole countries and were remembered by all the nations from father to son i inquired if he could tell me how i might come from this island and get among those white men he told me yes yes i might go in two canoe i could not understand what he meant by two canoe till at last with great difficulty i found he meant that it must be in a large great boat as big as two canoes this part of friday s discourse began to relish with me very well and from this time i entertained some hopes that one time or other i might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place and that this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it during the long time that friday had now been with me and that he began to speak to me and understand me i was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind particularly i asked him one time who made him the poor creature did not understand me at all but thought i had asked who was his father but i took it by another handle and asked him who made the sea the ground he walked on and the hills and woods he told me it was one old benamuckee that lived beyond all he could describe nothing of this great person but that he was very old much older he said than the sea or the land than the moon or the stars i asked him then if this old person had made all things why did not all things worship him he looked very grave and with a perfect look of innocence said all things said o to him i asked him if the people who die in his country went away any where he said yes they all went to benamuckee then i asked him whether those they ate up went thither too he said yes from these things i began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true god i told him that the great maker of all things lived there pointing up towards heaven that he governs the world by the same power and providence by which he made it that he was omnipotent could do every thing for us give every thing to us take every thing from us and thus by degrees i opened his eyes he listened with great attention and received with pleasure the notion of jesus christ being sent to redeem us and of the manner of making our prayers to god and his being able to hear us even into heaven he told me one day that if our god could hear us up beyond the sun he must needs be a greater god than their benamuckee who lived but a little way off and yet could not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him i asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him he said no they never went that were young men none went thither but the old men whom he called their oowookakee that is as i made him explain it to me their religious or clergy and that they went to say o so he called saying prayers and then came back and told them what benamuckee said by this i observed that there is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded ignorant pagans in the world and the policy of making a secret religion in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy is not only to be found in the roman but perhaps among all religious in the world even among the most brutish and barbarous savages i endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man friday and told him that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say o to their god benamuckee was a cheat and their bringing word from thence what he said was much more so that if they met with any answer or spoke with any one there it must be with an evil spirit and then i entered into a long discourse with him about the devil the original of him his rebellion against god his enmity to man the reason of it his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of god and as god and the many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin how he had a secret access to our passions and to our affections to adapt his snares so to our inclinations as to cause us even to be our own tempters and to run upon our own destruction by our own choice i found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the devil as it was about the being of a god nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great first cause and over ruling governing power a secret directing providence and of the equity and justice of paying homage to him that made us and the like but there appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit of his original his being his nature and above all of his inclination to do evil and to draw us in to do so too and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner by a question merely natural and innocent that i scarce knew what to say to him i had been talking a great deal to him of the power of god his omnipotence his dreadful aversion to sin his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity how as he had made as all he could destroy us and all the world in a moment and he listened with great seriousness to me all the while after this i had been telling him how the devil was god s enemy in the hearts of men and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of providence and to ruin the kingdom of christ in the world and the like well says friday but you say god is so strong so great is he not much strong much might as the devil yes yes said i friday god is stronger than the devil god is above the devil and therefore we pray to god to tread him under our feet and enable us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts but says he again if god much strong much might as the devil why god not kill the devil so make him no more wicked i was strangely surprised at his question and after all though i was now an old man yet i was but a young doctor and ill enough qualified for a casuist or a solver of difficulties and at first i could not tell what to say so i pretended not to hear him and asked him what he said but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question so that he repeated it in the very same broken words as above by this time i had recovered myself a little and i said god will at last punish him severely he is reserved for the judgment and is to be cast into the bottomless pit to dwell with everlasting fire this did not satisfy friday but he returns upon me repeating my words reserve at last me no understand but why not kill the devil now not kill great ago you may as well ask me said i why god does not kill you and me when we do wicked things here that offend him we are preserved to repent and be pardoned he muses awhile at this well well says he mighty affectionately that well so you i devil all wicked all preserve repent god pardon all here i was run down again by him to the last degree and it was a testimony to me how the mere notions of nature though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a god and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of god as the consequence of our nature yet nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge of jesus christ and of a redemption purchased for us of a mediator of a new covenant and of an intercessor at the footstool of god s throne i say nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in the soul and that therefore the gospel of our lord and saviour jesus christ i mean the word of god and the spirit of god promised for the guide and sanctifier of his people are the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of god and the means of salvation i therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man rising up hastily as upon some sudden occasion of going out then sending him for some thing a great way off i seriously prayed to god that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage assisting by his spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of god in christ reconciling him to himself and would guide me to speak so to him from the word of god as his conscience might be convinced his eyes opened and his soul saved when he came again to me i entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by the saviour of the world and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from heaven viz of the repentance towards god and faith in our blessed lord jesus i then explained to him as well as i could why our blessed redeemer took not on him the nature of angels but the seed of abraham and how for that reason the fallen angels had no share in the redemption that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of israel and the like i had god knows more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods i took for this poor creature s instruction and must acknowledge what i believe all that act upon the same principle will find that in laying things open to him i really informed and instructed myself in many things that either i did not know or had not fully considered before but which occurred naturally to my mind upon my searching into them for the information of this poor savage and i had more affection in my inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever i felt before so that whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no i had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to me my grief sat lighter upon me my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure and when i reflected that in this solitary life which i had been confined to i had not only been moved myself to look up to heaven and to seek to the hand that brought me thither but was now to be made an instrument under providence to save the life and for aught i knew the soul of a poor savage and bring him to the true knowledge of religion and of the christian doctrine that he might know christ jesus to know whom is life eternal i say when i reflected upon all these things a secret joy ran through every part of my soul and i frequently rejoiced that ever i was brought to this place which i had often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen me in this thankful frame i continued all the remainder of my time and the conversation which employed the hours between friday and me was such as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and completely happy if any such thing as complete happiness can be found in a sublunary state the savage was now a good christian a much better than i though i have reason to hope and bless god for it that we were equally penitent and comforted restored penitents we had here the word of god to read and no farther off from his spirit to instruct than if we had been in england i always applied myself to reading the scripture and to let him know as well as i could the meaning of what i read and he again by his serious inquiries and questions made me as i said before a much better scholar in the scripture knowledge than i should ever have been by my own private reading another thing i cannot refrain from observing here also from experience in this retired part of my life viz how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of god and of the doctrine of salvation by christ jesus is so plainly laid down in the word of god so easy to be received and understood that as the bare reading the scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for my sins and laying hold of a saviour for life and salvation to a stated reformation in practice and obedience to all god s commands and this without any teacher or instructor i mean human so the plain instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature and bringing him to be such a christian as i have known few equal to him in my life as to the disputes wranglings strife and contention which has happened in the world about religion whether niceties in doctrines or schemes of church government they were all perfectly useless to us as for aught i can yet see they have been to all the rest in the world we had the sure guide to heaven viz the word of god and we had blessed be god comfortable views of the spirit of god teaching and instructing us by his word leading us into all truth and making us both willing and obedient to his instruction of his word and i cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points in religion which have made such confusions in the world would have been to us if we could have obtained it but i must go on with the historical part of things and take every part in its order after friday and i became more intimately acquainted and that he could understand almost all i said to him and speak fluently though in broken english to me i acquainted him with my own story or at least so much of it as related to my coming into the place how i had lived there and how long i let him into the mystery for such it was to him of gunpowder and bullets and taught him how to shoot i gave him a knife which he was wonderfully delighted with and i made him a belt with a frog hanging to it such as in england we wear hangers in and in the frog instead of a hanger i gave him a hatchet which was not only as good a weapon in some cases but much more useful upon many occasions i described to him the countries of europe and particularly england which i came from how we lived how we worshipped god how we behaved to one another and how we traded in ships to all the parts of the world i gave him an account of the wreck which i had been on board of and shewed him as near as i could the place where she lay but she was all beaten in pieces long before and quite gone i shewed him the ruins of our boat which we lost when we escaped and which i could not stir with my whole strength then but was now fallen almost all to pieces upon seeing this boat friday stood musing a great while and said nothing i asked him what it was he studied upon at last says he me see such boat like come to place at my nation i did not understand him a good while but at last when i had examined further into it i understood by him that a boat such as that had been came on shore upon the country where he lived that is as he explained it was driven thither by stress of weather i presently imagined that some european ship must have been cast away upon their coast and the boat might get loose and drive ashore but was so dull that i never once thought of men making escape from a wreck thither much less whence they might come so i only inquired after a description of the boat friday described the boat to me well enough but brought me better to understand him when he added with some warmth we save the white mans from drown then i presently asked him if there were white mans as he called them in the boat yes he said the boat full of while mans i asked him how many he told upon his fingers seventeen i asked him then what became of them he told me they live they dwell at my nation this put new thoughts into my head again for i presently imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight of my island as i now call it and who after the ship was struck on the rock and they saw her inevitably lost had saved themselves in their boat and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages upon this i inquired of him more critically what was become of them he assured me they lived still there that they had been there about four years that the savages let them alone and gave them victuals to live i asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them he said no they make brother with them that is as i understood him a truce and then he added they eat no mans but when make the war fight that is to say they never eat any men but such as come to fight with them and are taken in battle it was after this some considerable time that being on the top of the hill at the east side of the island from whence as i have said i had in a clear day discovered the main or continent of america friday the weather being very serene looks very earnestly towards the main land and in a kind of surprise falls a jumping and dancing and calls out to me for i was at some distance from him i asked him what was the matter o joy says he o glad there see my country there my nation i observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face and his eyes sparkled and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness as if he had a mind to be in his own country again and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me which made me at first not so easy about my new man friday as i was before and i made no doubt but that if friday could get back to his own nation again he would not only forget all his religion but all his obligations to me and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me and come back perhaps with an hundred or two of them and make a feast upon me at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies when they were taken in war but i wronged the poor honest creature very much for which i was very sorry afterwards however as my jealousy increased and held me some weeks i was a little more circumspect and not so familiar and kind to him as before in which i was certainly in the wrong too the honest grateful creature having no thought about it but what consisted of the best principles both as a religious christian and as a grateful friend as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction whilst my jealousy of him lasted you may be sure i was every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which i suspected were in him but i found every thing he said was so honest and so innocent that i could find nothing to nourish my suspicion and in spite of all my uneasiness he made me at last entirely his own again nor did he in the least perceive that i was uneasy and therefore i could not suspect him of deceit one day walking up the same hill but the weather being hazy at sea so that we could not see the continent i called to him and said friday do not you wish yourself in your own country your own nation yes he said i be much o glad to be at my own nation what would you do there said i would you turn wild again eat men s flesh again and be a savage as you were before he looked full of concern and shaking his head said no no friday tell them to live good tell them to pray god tell them to eat corn bread cattle flesh milk no eat man again why then said i to him they will kill you he looked grave at that and then said no they no kill me they willing love learn he meant by this they would be willing to learn he added they learnt much of the bearded mans that came in the boat then i asked him if he would go back to them he smiled at that and told me he could not swim so far i told him i would make a canoe for him he told me he would go if i would so with him i go said i why they will eat me if i come there no no says he me make them no eat you me make they much love you he meant he would tell them how i had killed his enemies and saved his life and so he would make them love me then he told me as well as he could how kind they were to seventeen white men or bearded men as he called them who came on shore in distress from this time i confess i had a mind to venture over and see if i could possibly join with these bearded men who i made no doubt were spaniards or portuguese not doubting but if i could we might find some method to escape from thence being upon the continent and a good company together better than i could from an island forty miles off the shore and alone without help so after some days i took friday to work again by way of discourse and told him i would give him a boat to go back to his own nation and accordingly i carried him to my frigate which lay on the other side of the island and having cleared it of water for i always kept it sunk in the water i brought it out shewed it him and we both went into it i found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it would make it go almost as swift and fast again as i could so when he was in i said to him well now friday shall we go to your nation he looked very dull at my saying so which it seems was because he thought the boat too small to go so far i told him then i had a bigger so the next day i went to the place where the first boat lay which i had made but which i could not get into the water he said that was big enough but then as i had taken no care of it and it had lain two or three and twenty years there the sun had split and dried it that it was in a manner rotten friday told me such a boat would do very well and would carry much enough vittle drink bread that was his way of talking upon the whole i was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over with him to the continent that i told him we would go and make one as big as that and he should go home in it he answered not one word but looked very grave and sad i asked him what was the matter with him he asked me again thus why you angry mad with friday what me done i asked him what he meant i told him i was not angry with him at all no angry no angry says he repeating the words several times why send friday home away to my nation why said i friday did you not say you wished you were there yes yes says he wish be both there no wish friday there no master there in a word he would not think of going there without me i go there friday said i what should i do there he turned very quick upon me at this you do great deal much good says he you teach wild mans be good sober tame mans you tell them know god pray god and live new life alas friday said i thou knowest not what thou sayest i am but an ignorant man myself yes yes says he you teechee me good you teechee them good no no friday said i you shall go without me leave me here to live by myself as i did before he looked confused again at that word and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear he takes it up hastily and gives it me what must i do with this said i to him you take kill friday says he what must i kill you for said i again he returns very quick what you send friday away for take kill friday no send friday away this he spoke so earnestly that i saw tears stand in his eyes in a word i so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me and a firm resolution in him that i told him then and often after that i would never send him away from me if he was willing to stay with me upon the whole as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me and that nothing should part him from me so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people and his hopes of my doing them good a thing which as i had no notion of myself so i had not the least thought or intention or desire of undertaking it but still i found a strong inclination to my attempting an escape as above founded on the supposition gathered from the former discourse viz that there were seventeen bearded men there and therefore without any delay i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell and make a large periagua or canoe to under take the voyage there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet not of periaguas and canoes only but even of good large vessels but the main thing i looked at was to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made to avoid the mistake i committed at first at last friday pitched upon a tree for i found he knew much better than i what kind of wood was fittest for it nor can i tell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down except that it was very like the tree we call tustick or between that and the nicaragua wood for it was much of the same colour and smell friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out to make it into a boat but i shewed him how rather to cut it out with tools which after i shewed him how to use he did very handily and in about a month s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome especially when with our axes which i shewed him how to handle we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat after this however it cost us near a fortnight s time to get her along as it were inch by inch upon great rollers into the water but when she was in she would have carried twenty men with great ease when she was in the water and though she was so big it amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man friday could manage her turn her and paddle her along so i asked him if he would and if we might venture over in her yes he said he venture over in her very well though great blow wind however i had a farther design that he knew nothing of and that was to make a mast and sail and to fit her with an anchor and cable as to a mast that was easy enough to get so i pitched upon a straight young cedar tree which i found near the place and which there was a great plenty of in the island and i set friday to work to cut it down and gave him directions how to shape and order it but as to the sail that was my particular care i knew i had old sails or rather pieces of old sails enough but as i had had them now twenty six years by me and had not been very careful to preserve them not imagining that i should ever have this kind of use for them i did not doubt but they were all rotten and indeed most of them were so however i found two pieces which appeared pretty good and with these i went to work and with a great deal of pains and awkward tedious stitching you may be sure for want of needles i at length made a three cornered ugly thing like what we call in england a shoulder of mutton sail to go with a boom at bottom and a little short sprit at the top such as usually our ships long boats sail with and such as i best knew how to manage because it was such a one as i used in the boat in which i made my escape from barbary as related in the first part of my story i was near two months performing this last work viz rigging and fitting my mast and sails for i finished them very complete making a small stay and a sail or foresail to it to assist if we should turn to windward and which was more than all i fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with and though i was but a bungling shipwright yet as i knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing i applied myself with so much pains to do it that at last i brought it to pass though considering the many dull contrivances i had for it that failed i think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat after all this was done i had my man friday to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat for though he knew very well how to paddle the canoe he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder and was the more amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder and how the sail gibed and filled this way or that way as the course we sailed changed i say when he saw this he stood like one astonished and amazed however with a little use i made all these things familiar to him and he became an expert sailor except that as to the compass i could make him understand very little of that on the other hand as there was very little cloudy weather and seldom or never any fogs in those parts there was the less occasion for a compass seeing the stars were always to be seen by night and the shore by day except in the rainy seasons and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or sea i was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my captivity in this place though the three last years that i had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of my time i kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to god for his mercies as at first and if i had such cause of acknowledgment at first i had much more so now having such additional testimonies of the care of providence over me and the great hopes i had of being effectually and speedily delivered for i had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand and that i should not be another year in this place however i went on with my husbandry digging planting and fencing as usual i gathered and cured my grapes and did every necessary thing as before the rainy season was in the mean time upon me when i kept more within doors than at other times so i had stowed our now vessel as secure as we could bringing her up into the creek where as i said in the beginning i landed my rafts from the ship and haling her up to the shore at high water mark i made my man friday dig a little dock just big enough for her to float in and then when the tide was out we made a strong dam cross the end of it to keep the water out and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea and to keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees so thick that she was as well thatched as a house and thus we waited for the months of november and december in which i designed to make my adventure when the settled season began to come in as the thought of my design returned with the fair weather i was preparing daily for the voyage and the first thing i did was to lay up a certain quantity of provision being the store for the voyage and intended in a week or a fortnight s time to open the dock and launch out our boat i was busy one morning upon something of this kind when i called to friday and bid him go to the sea shore and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise a thing which we generally got once a week for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh friday had not been long gone when he came running back and flew over my outward wall or fence like one that felt not the ground or the steps he set his feet on and before i had time to speak to him he cried out to me o master o master o sorrow o bad what s the matter friday said i o yonder there says he one two three canoe one two three by this way of speaking i concluded there were six but on inquiry i found there were but three well friday said i do not be frighted so i heartened him up as well as i could however i saw the poor fellow most terribly scared for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him and would cut him in pieces and eat him the poor fellow trembled so that i scarce knew what to do with him i comforted him as well as i could and told him i was in as much danger as he and that they would eat me as well as him but said i friday we must resolve to fight them can you fight friday me shoot says he but there come many great number no matter for that said i again our guns will fright them that we do not kill so i asked him whether if i resolved to defend him he would defend me and stand by me and do just as i bade him he said me die when you bid die master so i went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him for i had been so good a husband of my rum that i had a great deal left when he had drank it i made him take the two fowling pieces which we always carried and load them with large swan shot as big as small pistol bullets then i took four muskets and loaded them with two slugs and five small bullets each and my two pistols i loaded with a brace of bullets each i hung my great sword as usual naked by my side and gave friday his hatchet when i had thus prepared myself i took my perspective glass and went up to the side of the hill to see what i could discover and i found quickly by my glass that there were one and twenty savages three prisoners and three canoes and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies a barbarous feast indeed but nothing more than as i had observed was usual with them i observed also that they were landed not where they had done when friday made his escape but nearer to my creek where the shore was low and where a thick wood came close almost down to the sea this with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about so filled me with indignation that i came down again to friday and told him i was resolved to go down to them and kill them all and asked him if he would stand by me he was now gotten over his fright and his spirits being a little raised with the dram i had given him he was very cheerful and told me as before he would die when i bid die in this fit of fury i took first and divided the arms which i had charged as before between us i gave friday one pistol to stick in his girdle and three guns upon his shoulder and i took one pistol and the other three myself and in this posture we marched out i took a small bottle of rum in my pocket and gave friday a large bag with more powder and bullet and as to orders i charged him to keep close behind me and not to stir shoot or do any thing till i bid him and in the mean time not to speak a word in this posture i fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood so that i might come within shot of them before i could be discovered which i had seen by my glass it was easy to do while i was making this march my former thoughts returning i began to abate my resolution i do not mean that i entertained any fear of their number for as they were naked unarmed wretches it is certain i was superior to them nay though i had been alone but it occurred to my thoughts what call what occasion much less what necessity i was in to go and dip my hands in blood to attack people who had neither done or intended me any wrong who as to me were innocent and whose barbarous customs were their own disaster being in them a token indeed of god s having left them with the other nations of that part of the world to such stupidity and to such inhuman courses but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions much less an executioner of his justice that whenever he thought fit he would take the cause into his own hands and by national vengeance punish them for national crimes but that in the mean time it was none of my business that it was true friday might justify it because he was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very particular people and it was lawful for him to attack them but i could not say the same with respect to me these things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as i went that i resolved i would only go place myself near them that i might observe their barbarous feast and that i would act then as god should direct but that unless something offered that was more a call to me than yet i knew of i would not meddle with them with this resolution i entered the wood and with all possible wariness and silence friday following close at my heels i marched till i came to the skirt of the wood on the side which was next to them only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them here i called softly to friday and shewing him a great tree which was just at the corner of the wood i bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing he did so and came immediately back to me and told me they might be plainly viewed there that they were all about the fire eating the flesh of one of their prisoners and that another lay bound upon the sand a little from them whom he said they would kill next and which fired the very soul within me he told me it was not one of their nation but one of the bearded men whom he had told me of who came to their country in the boat i was filled with horror at the very naming the white bearded man and going to the tree i saw plainly by my glass a white man who lay upon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags or things like rushes and that he was an european and had clothes on there was another tree and a little thicket beyond it about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where i was which by going a little way about i saw i might come at undiscovered and that then i should be within half shot of them so i withheld my passion though i was indeed enraged to the highest degree and going back about twenty paces i got behind some bushes which held all the way till i came to the other tree and then i came to a little rising ground which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards i had now not a moment to lose for nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all close huddled together and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor christian and bring him perhaps limb by limb to their fire and they were stooped down to untie the bands at his feet i turned to friday now friday said i do as i bid thee friday said he would then friday said i do exactly as you see me do fail in nothing so i set down one of the muskets and the fowling piece upon the ground and friday did the like by his and with the other musket i took my aim at the savages bidding him do the like then asking him if he was ready he said yes then fire at them said i and the same moment i fired also friday took his aim so much better than i that on the side that he shot he killed two of them and wounded three more and on my side i killed one and wounded two they were you may be sure in a dreadful consternation and all of them who were not hurt jumped up upon their feet immediately but did not know which way to run or which way to look for they knew not from whence their destruction came friday kept his eyes close upon me that as i had bid him he might observe what i did so as soon as the first shot was made i threw down the piece and took up the fowling piece and friday did the like he sees me cock and present he did the same again are you ready friday said i yes says he let fly then said i in the name of god and with that i fired again among the amazed wretches and so did friday and as our pieces were now loaden with what i call swan shot or small pistol bullets we found only two drop but so many were wounded that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures all bloody and miserably wounded most of them whereof three more fell quickly after though not quite dead now friday said i laying down the discharged pieces and taking up the musket which was yet loaden follow me said i which he did with a deal of courage upon which i rushed out of the wood and shewed myself and friday close at my foot as soon as i perceived they saw me i shouted as loud as i could and bade friday do so too and running as fast as i could which by the way was not very fast being loaded with arms as i was i made directly towards the poor victim who was as i said lying upon the beach or shore between the place where they sat and the sea the two butchers who were just going to work with him had left him at the surprise of our first fire and fled in a terrible fright to the sea side and had jumped into a canoe and three more of the rest made the same way i turned to friday and bade him step forwards and fire at them he understood me immediately and running about forty yards to be near them he shot at them and i thought he had killed them all for i saw them all fall on an heap into the boat though i saw two of them up again quickly however he killed two of them and wounded the third so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead while my man friday fired at them i pulled out my knife and cut the flags that bound the poor victim and loosing his hands and feet i lifted him up and asked him in the portuguese tongue what he was he answered in latin christianus but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand or speak i took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him making signs that he should drink which he did and i gave him a piece of bread which he ate then i asked him what countryman he was and he said espagnole and being a little recovered let me know by all the signs he could possibly make how much he was in my debt for his deliverance seignior said i with as much spanish as i could make up we will talk afterwards but we must fight now if you have any strength left take this pistol and sword and lay about you he took them very thankfully and no sooner had he the arms in his hands but as if they had put new vigour into him he flew upon his murderers like a fury and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant for the truth is as the whole was a surprise to them so the poor creatures were so much frighted with the noise of our pieces that they fell down for mere amazement and fear and had no more power to attempt their own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot and that was the case of those five that friday shot in the boat for as three of them fell with the hurt they received so the other two fell with the fright i kept my piece in my hand still without firing being willing to keep my charge ready because i had given the spaniard my pistol and sword so i called to friday and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged which he did with great swiftness and then giving him my musket i sat down myself to load all the rest again and bade them come to me when they wanted while i was loading these pieces there happened a fierce engagement between the spaniard and one of the savages who made at him with one of their great wooden swords the same weapon that was to have killed him before if i had not prevented it the spaniard who was as bold and as brave as could be imagined though weak had fought this indian a good while and had cut him two great wounds on his head but the savage being a stout lusty fellow closing in with him had thrown him down being faint and was wringing my sword out of his hand when the spaniard though undermost wisely quitting his sword drew the pistol from his girdle shot the savage through the body and killed him upon the spot before i who was running to help could come near him friday being now left at his liberty pursued the flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet and with that he dispatched those three who as i said before were wounded at first and fallen and all the rest he could come up with and the spaniard coming to me for a gun i gave him one of the fowling pieces with which he pursued two of the savages and wounded them both but as he was not able to run they both got from him into the wood where friday pursued them and killed one of them but the other was too nimble for him and though he was wounded yet he plunged into the sea and swam with all his might off to those who were left in the canoe which three in the canoe with one wounded who we know not whether he died or no were all that escaped our hands of one and twenty the account of the rest is as follows 3 killed at our shot from the tree 2 killed at the next shot 2 killed by friday in the boat 2 killed by ditto of those at first wounded 1 killed by ditto in the wood 3 killed by the spaniard 4 killed being found dropt here and there of their wounds or killed by friday in his chase of them 4 escaped in the boat whereof one wounded if not dead 21 in all those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun shot and though friday made two or three shot at them i did not find that he hit any of them friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes and pursue them and indeed i was very anxious about their escape lest carrying the news home to their people they should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their canoes and devour us by mere multitudes so i consented to pursue them by sea and running to one of their canoes i jumped in and bade friday follow me but when i was in the canoe i was surprised to find another poor creature lie there alive bound hand and foot as the spaniard was for the slaughter and almost dead with fear not knowing what the matter was for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat he was tied so hard neck and heels and had been tied so long that he had really little life in him i immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him with and would have helped him up but he could not stand or speak but groaned most piteously believing it seems still that he was only unbound in order to be killed when friday came to him i bade him speak to him and tell him of his deliverance and pulling out my bottle made him give the poor wretch a dram which with the news of his being delivered revived him and he sat up in the boat but when friday came to hear him speak and looked in his face it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how friday kissed him embraced him hugged him cried laughed hallooed jumped about danced sung then cried again wrung his hands beat his own face and head and then sung and jumped about again like a distracted creature it was a good while before i could make him speak to me or tell me what was the matter but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his father it was not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father and of his being delivered from death nor indeed can i describe half the extravagances of his affection after this for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great many times when he went in to him he would sit down by him open his breast and hold his father s head close to his bosom half an hour together to nourish it then he took his arms and ankles which were numbed and stiff with the binding and chafed and rubbed them with his hands and i perceiving what the case was gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with which did them a great deal of good this action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savages who were now gotten almost out of sight and it was happy for us that we did not for it blew so hard within two hours after and before they could be gotten a quarter of their way and continued blowing so hard all night and that from the north west which was against them that i could not suppose their boat could live or that they ever reached to their own coast but to return to friday he was so busy about his father that i could not find in my heart to take him off for some time but after i thought he could leave him a little i called him to me and he came jumping and laughing and pleased to the highest extreme then i asked him if he had given his father any bread he shook his head and said none ugly dog eat all up self so i gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch i carried on purpose i also gave him a dram for himself but he would not taste it but carried it to his father i had in my pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins so i gave him a handful of them for his father he had no sooner given his father these raisins but i saw him come out of the boat and run away as if he had been bewitched he ran at such a rate for he was the swiftest fellow of his feet that ever i saw i say he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight as it were in an instant and though i called and hallooed too after him it was all one away he went and in a quarter of an hour i saw him come back again though not so fast as he went and as he came nearer i found his pace was slacker because he had something in his hand when he came up to me i found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot to bring his father some fresh water and that he had get two more cakes or loaves of bread the bread he gave me but the water he carried to his father however as i was very thirsty too i took a little sip of it this water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits i had given him for he was just fainting with thirst when his father had drank i called him to know if there was any water left he said yes and i bade him give it to the poor spaniard who was in as much want of it as his father and i sent one of the cakes that friday brought to the spaniard too who was indeed very weak and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree and whose limbs were also very stiff and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with when i saw that upon friday s coming to him with the water he sat up and drank and took the bread and began to eat i went to him and gave him a handful of raisins he looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance but was so weak notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight that he could not stand upon his feet he tried to do it two or three times but was really not able his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him so i bade him sit still and caused friday to rub his ankles and bathe them with rum as he had done his father s i observed the poor affectionate creature every two minutes or perhaps less all the while he was here turned his head about to see if his father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting and at last he found he was not to be seen at which he started up and without speaking a word flew with that swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went but when he came he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs so friday came back to me presently and i then spoke to the spaniard to let friday help him up if he could and load him to the boat and then he should carry him to our dwelling where i would take care of him but friday a lusty young fellow took the spaniard quite up upon his back and carried him away to the boat and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe with his feet in the inside of it and then lifted them quite in and set him close to his father and presently stepping out again launched the boat off and paddled it along the shore faster than i could walk though the wind blew pretty hard too so he brought them both safe into our creek and leaving them in the boat runs away to fetch the other canoe as he passed me i spoke to him and asked him whither he went he told me go fetch more boat so away he went like the wind for sure never man or horse ran like him and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as i got to it by land so he wafted me over and then went to help our new guests out of the boat which he did but they were neither of them able to walk so that poor friday knew not what to do to remedy this i went to work in my thought and calling to friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me i soon made a kind of hand barrow to lay them on and friday and i carried them up both together upon it between us but when we got them to the outside of our wall or fortification we were at a worse loss than before for it was impossible to get them over and i was resolved not to break it down so i set to work again and friday and i in about two hours time made a very handsome tent covered with old sails and above that with boughs of trees being in the space without our outward fence and between that and the grove of young wood which i had planted and here we made two beds of such things as i had viz of good rice straw with blankets laid upon it to lie on and another to cover them on each bed my island was now peopled and i thought myself very rich in subjects and it was a merry reflection which i frequently made how like a king i looked first of all the whole country was my own mere property so that i had an undoubted right of dominion 2dly my people were perfectly subjected i was absolute lord and lawgiver they all owed their lives to me and were ready to lay down their lives if there had been occasion for it for me it was remarkable too i had but three subjects and they were of three different religions my man friday was a protestant his father a pagan and a cannibal and the spaniard was a papist however i allowed liberty of conscience throughout my dominions but this by the way as soon as i had secured my two weak rescued prisoners and given them shelter and a place to rest them upon i began to think of making some provision for them and the first thing i did i ordered friday to take a yearling goat betwixt a kid and a goat out of my particular flock to be killed then i cut off the hind quarter and chopping it into small pieces i set friday to work to boiling and stewing and made them a very good dish i assure you of flesh and broth having put some barley and rice also into the broth and as i cooked it without doors for i made no fire within my inner wall so i carried it all into the new tent and having set a table there for them i sat down and ate my dinner also with them and as well as i could cheered them and encouraged them friday being my interpreter especially to his father and indeed to the spaniard too for the spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well after we had dined or rather supped i ordered friday to take one of the canoes and go and fetch our muskets and other fire arms which for want of time we had left upon the place of battle and the next day i ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages which lay open to the sun and would presently be offensive and i also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast which i knew were pretty much and which i could not think of doing myself nay i could not bear to see them if i went that way all which he punctually performed and defaced the very appearance of the savages being there so that when i went again i could scarce know where it was otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place i then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects and first i set friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe and whether he might expect a return of them with a power too great for us to resist his first opinion was that the savages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night they went off but must of necessity be drowned or driven south to those other shores where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away but as to what they would do if they came safe on shore he said he knew not but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted with the manner of being attacked the noise and the fire that he believed they would tell their people they were all killed by thunder and lightning and not by the hand of man and that the two which appeared viz friday and i were two heavenly spirits or furies come down to destroy them and not men with weapons this he said he knew because he heard them all cry out so in their language to one another for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man should dart fire and speak thunder and kill at a distance without lifting up the hand as was done now and this old savage was in the right for as i understood since by other hands the savages of that part never attempted to go over to the island afterwards they were so terrified with the accounts given by these four men for it seems they did escape the sea that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the gods this however i knew not and therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while and kept always upon my guard i and all my army for as there were now four of us i would have ventured a hundred of them fairly in the open field at any time in a little time however no more canoes appearing the fear of their coming wore off and i began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration being likewise assured by friday s father that i might depend upon good usage from their nation on his account if i would go but my thoughts were a little suspended when i had a serious discourse with the spaniard and when i understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and portuguese who having been cast away and made their escape to that side lived there at peace indeed with the savages but were very sore put to it for necessaries and indeed for life i asked him all the particulars of their voyage and found they were a spanish ship bound from the rio de la plata to the havanna being directed to leave their loading there which was chiefly hides and silver and to bring back what european goods they could meet with there that they had five portuguese seamen on board whom they took out of another wreck that five of their own men were drowned when first the ship was lost and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards and arrived almost starved on the cannibal coast where they expected to have been devoured every moment he told me they had some arms with them but they were perfectly useless for that they had neither powder nor ball the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a little which they used at their first landing to provide themselves some food i asked him what he thought would become of them there and if they had formed no design of making any escape he said they had many consultations about it but that having neither vessel nor tools to build one or provisions of any kind their counsels always ended in tears and despair i asked him how be thought they would receive a proposal from me which might tend towards an escape and whether if they were all here it might not be done i told him with freedom i feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me if i put my life in their hands for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they had received so much as they did by the advantages they expected i told him it would be very hard that i should be the instrument of their deliverance and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in new spain where an englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither and that i had rather be delivered up to the savages and be devoured alive than fall into the merciless claws of the priests and be carried into the inquisition i added that otherwise i was persuaded if they were all here we might with so many hands build a bark large enough to carry us all away either to the brasils southward or to the islands or spanish coast northward but that if in requital they should when i had put weapons into their hands carry me by force among their own people i might be ill used for my kindness to them and make my case worse than it was before he answered with a great deal of candour and ingenuity that their condition was so miserable and they were so sensible of it that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance and that if i pleased he would go to them with the old man and discourse with them about it and return again and bring me their answer that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn oath that they would be absolutely under my leading as their commander and captain and that they should swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me and go to such christian country as i should agree to and no other and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as i intended and that he would bring a contract from them under their hands for that purpose then he told me he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me as long as he lived till i gave him order and that he would take my side to the last drop of blood if there should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen he told me they were all of them very civil honest men and they were under the greatest distress imaginable having neither weapons or clothes nor any food but at the mercy and discretion of the savages out of all hopes of ever returning to their own country and that he was sure if i would undertake their relief they would live and die by me upon these assurances i resolved to venture to relieve them if possible and to send the old savage and the spaniard over to them to treat but when he had gotten all things in readiness to go the spaniard himself started an objection which had so much prudence in it on one hand and so much sincerity on the other hand that i could not but be very well satisfied in it and by his advice put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year the case was thus he had been with us now about a month during which time i had let him see in what manner i had provided with the assistance of providence for my support and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice i had laid up which as it was more than sufficient for myself so it was not sufficient at least without good husbandry for my family now it was increased to number four but much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen who were as he said fourteen still alive should come over and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel if we should build one for a voyage to any of the christian colonies of america so he told me he thought it would be more adviseable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some more land as much as i could spare seed to sow and that we should wait another harvest that we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen when they should come for want might be a temptation to them to disagree or not to think themselves delivered otherwise than out of one difficulty into another you know says he the children of israel though they rejoiced at first at their being delivered out of egypt yet rebelled even against god himself that delivered them when they came to want bread in the wilderness his caution was so seasonable and his advice so good that i could not but be very well pleased with his proposal as well as i was satisfied with his fidelity so we fell to digging all four of us as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted and in about a month s time by the end of which it was seed time we had gotten as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed twenty two bushels of barley on and sixteen jars of rice which was in short all the seed we had to spare nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the six months that we had to expect our crop that is to say reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country having now society enough and our number being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages if they had come unless their number had been very great we went freely all over the island wherever we found occasion and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts it was impossible at least for me to have the means of it out of mine to this purpose i marked out several trees which i thought fit for our work and i set friday and his father to cutting them down and then i caused the spaniard to whom i imparted my thoughts on that affair to oversee and direct their work i showed them with what indefatigable pains i had hewed a large tree into single planks and i caused them to do the like till they had about a dozen large planks of good oak near two feet broad thirty five feet long and from two inches to four inches thick what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine at the same time i contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as much as i could and to this purpose i made friday and the spaniard to go out one day and myself with friday the next day for we took our turns and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest for whenever we shot the dam we saved the kids and added them to our flock but above all the season for curing the grapes coming on i caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun that i believe had we been at alicant where the raisins of the sun are cured we should have filled sixty or eighty barrels and these with our bread was a great part of our food and very good living too i assure you for it is an exceeding nourishing food it was now harvest and our crop in good order it was not the most plentiful increase i had seen in the island but however it was enough to answer our end for from twenty two bushels of barley we brought in and threshed out above two hundred and twenty bushels and the like in proportion of the rice which was store enough for our food to the next harvest though all the sixteen spaniards had been on shore with me or if we had been ready for a voyage it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world that is to say of america when we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn we fell to work to make more wicker work viz great baskets in which we kept it and the spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part and often blamed me that i did not make some things for defence of this kind of work but i saw no need of it and now having a full supply of food for all the guests expected i gave the spaniard leave to go over to the main to see what he could do with those he left behind him there i gave him a strict charge in writing not to bring any man with him who would not first swear in the presence of himself and of the old savage that he would no way injure fight with or attack the person he should find in the island who was so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance but that they would stand by and defend him against all such attempts and wherever they went would be entirely under and subjected to his command and that this should be put in writing and signed with their hands how we were to have this done when i knew they had neither pen or ink that indeed was a question which we never asked under these instructions the spaniard and the old savage the father of friday went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to come in or rather were brought in when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages i gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it and about eight charges of powder and ball charging them to be very good husbands of both and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions this was a cheerful work being the first measures used by me in view of my deliverance for now twenty seven years and some days i gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes sufficient for themselves for many days and sufficient for their countrymen for about eight days time and wishing them a good voyage i let them go agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out at their return by which i should know them again when they came back at a distance before they came on shore they went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at the full by my account in the month of october but as for the exact reckoning of days after i had once lost it i could never recover it again nor had i kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure that i was right though as it proved when i afterwards examined my account i found i had kept a true reckoning of years it was no less than eight days i waited for them when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened of which the like has not perhaps been heard of in history i was fast asleep in my hutch one morning when my man friday came running in to me and called aloud master master they are come they are come i jumped up and regardless of danger i went out as soon as i could get my clothes on through my little grove which by the way was by this time grown to be a very thick wood i say regardless of danger i went without my arms which was not my custom to do but i was surprised when turning my eyes to the sea i presently saw a boat at about a league and a half s distance standing in for the shore with a shoulder of mutton sail as they call it and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in also i observed presently that they did not come from that side which the shore lay on but from the southernmost end of the island upon this i called friday in and bid him be close for these were not the people we looked for and that we did not know yet whether they were friends or enemies in the next place i went in to fetch my perspective glass to see what i could make of them and having taken the ladder out i climbed up to the top of the hill as i used to do when i was apprehensive of any thing and to take my view the plainer without being discovered i had scarce set my foot on the hill when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor at about two leagues and a half s distance from me s s e but not above a league and a half from the shore by my observation it appeared plainly to be an english ship and the boat appeared to be an english long boat i cannot express the confusion i was in though the joy of seeing a ship and one whom i had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen and consequently friends was such as i cannot describe but yet i had some secret doubts hung about me i cannot tell from whence they came bidding me keep upon my guard in the first place it occurred to me to consider what business an english ship could have in that part of the world since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the english had any traffic and i knew there had been no storms to drive them in there as in distress and that if they were english really it was most probable that they were here upon no good design and that i had better continue as i was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being real that such hints and notices are given us i believe few that have made any observation of things can deny that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world and a converse of spirits we cannot doubt and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent whether supreme or inferior and subordinate is not the question and that they are given for our good the present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this reasoning for had i not been made cautious by this secret admonition come from whence it will i had been undone inevitably and in a far worse condition than before as you will see presently i had not kept myself long in this posture but i saw the boat draw near the shore as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of landing however as they did not come quite far enough they did not see the little inlet where i formerly landed my rafts but run their boat on shore upon the beach at about half a mile from me which was very happy for me for otherwise they would have landed just as i may say at my door and would have soon beaten me out of my castle and perhaps have plundered me of all i had when they were on shore i was fully satisfied they were englishmen at least most of them one or two i thought were dutch but it did not prove so there were in all eleven men whereof three of them i found were unarmed and as i thought bound and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore they took those three out of the boat as prisoners one of the three i could perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty affliction and despair even to a kind of extravagance the other two i could perceive lifted up their hands sometimes and appeared concerned indeed but not to such a degree as the first i was perfectly confounded at the sight and knew not what the meaning of it should be friday called out to me in english as well as he could o master you see english mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans why said i friday do you think they are going to eat them then yes says friday they will eat them no no said i friday i am afraid they will murder them indeed but you may be sure they will not eat them all this while i had no thought of what the matter really was but stood trembling with the horror of the sight expecting every moment when the three prisoners should be killed nay once i saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass as the seamen call it or sword to strike one of the poor men and i expected to see him fall every moment at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins i wished heartily now for our spaniard and the savage that was gone with him or that i had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them that i might have rescued the three men for i saw no fire arms they had among them but it fell out to my mind another way after i had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen i observed the fellows ran scattering about the land as if they wanted to see the country i observed also that the three other men had liberty to go where they pleased but they sat down all three upon the ground very pensive and looked like men in despair this put me in mind of the finest time when i came on shore and began to look about me how i gave myself over for lost how wildly i looked round me what dreadful apprehensions i had and how i lodged in the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts as i knew nothing that night of the supply i was to receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and tides by which i have since been so long nourished and supported so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were how near it was to them and how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety at the same time they thought themselves lost and their case desperate so little do we see before us in the world and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great maker of the world that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute but that in the worst circumstances they have always something to be thankful for and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine nay are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction it was just at the top of high water when these people came on shore and while partly they stood parleying with the prisoners they brought and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of place they were in they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent and the water was ebbed considerably away leaving their boat aground they had left two men in the boat who as i found afterwards having drank a little too much brandy fell asleep however one of them waking sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it hallooed for the rest who were straggling about upon which they all soon came to the boat but it was past all their strength to launch her the boat being very heavy and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand almost like a quicksand in this condition like true seamen who are perhaps the least of all mankind given to fore thought they gave it over and away they strolled about the country again and i heard one of them say aloud to another calling them off from the boat why let her alone jack can t ye she ll float next tide by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were all this while i kept myself close not once daring to stir out of my castle any further than to my place of observation near the top of the hill and very glad i was to think how well it was fortified i know it was no less then ten hours before the boat could be on float again and by that time it would be dark and i might be more at liberty to see their motions and to hear their discourse if they had any in the meantime i fitted myself up for a battle as before though with more caution knowing i had to do with another kind of enemy than i had at first i ordered friday also whom i had made an excellent marksman with his gun to load himself with arms i took myself two fowling pieces and i gave him three muskets my figure indeed was very fierce i had my formidable goat skin coat on with the great cap i mentioned a naked sword two pistols in my belt and a gun upon each shoulder it was my design as i said above not to have made any attempt till it was dark but about two o clock being the heat of the day i found that in short they were all gone straggling into the woods and as i thought were all laid down to sleep the three poor distressed men too anxious for their condition to get any sleep were however set down under the shelter of a great tree at about a quarter of a mile from me and as i thought out of sight of any of the rest upon this i resolved to discover myself to them and learn something of their condition immediately i marched in the figure above my man friday at a good distance behind me as formidable for his arms as i but not making quite so staring a spectre like figure as i did i came as near them undiscovered as i could and then before any of them saw me i called aloud to them in spanish what are ye gentlemen they started up at the noise but were ten times more confounded when they saw me and the uncouth figure that i made they made no answer at all but i thought i perceived them just going to fly from me when i spoke to them in english gentlemen said i do not be surprized at me perhaps you may have a friend near you when you did not expect it he must be sent directly from heaven then said one of them very gravely to me and pulling off his hat at the same time to me for our condition is past the help of man all help is from heaven sir said i but can you put a stranger in the way how to help you for you seem to me to be in some great distress i saw you when you landed and when you seemed to make applications to the brutes that came with you i saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you the poor man with tears running down his face and trembling looking like one astonished returned am i talking to god or man is it a real man or an angel be in no fear about that sir said i if god had sent an angel to relieve you he would have come better cloathed and armed after another manner than you see me in pray lay aside your fears i am a man an englishman and disposed to assist you you see i have one servant only we have arms and ammunition tell us freely can we serve you what is your case our case said he sir is too long to tell you while our murtherers are so near but in short sir i was commander of that ship my men have mutinied against me they have been hardly prevailed on not to murther me and at last have set me on shore in this desolate place with these two men with me one my mate the other a passenger where we expected to perish believing the place to be uninhabited and know not yet what to think of it where are those brutes your enemies said i do you know where they are gone there they lye sir said he pointing to a thicket of trees my heart trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak if they have they will certainly murther us all have they any fire arms said i he answered they had only two pieces and one which they left in the boat well then said i leave the rest to me i see they are all asleep it is an easy thing to kill them all but shall we rather take them prisoners he told me there were two desperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to shew any mercy to but if they were secured he believed all the rest would return to their duty i asked him which they were he told me he could not at that distance describe them but he would obey my orders in any thing i would direct well says i let us retreat out of their view or hearing least they awake and we will resolve further so they willingly went back with me till the woods covered us from them look you sir said i if i venture upon your deliverance are you willing to make two conditions with me he anticipated my proposals by telling me that both he and the ship if recovered should be wholly directed and commanded by me in every thing and if the ship was not recovered he would live and dye with me in what part of the world soever i would send him and the two other men said the same well says i my conditions are but two 1 that while you stay on this island with me you will not pretend to any authority here and if i put arms into your hands you will upon all occasions give them up to me and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island and in the mean time be governed by my orders 2 that if the ship is or may be recovered you will carry me and my man to england passage free he gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of a man could devise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands and besides would owe his life to me and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived well then said i here are three muskets for you with powder and ball tell me next what you think is proper to be done he shewed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was able but offered to be wholly guided by me i told him i thought it was hard venturing any thing but the best method i could think of was to fire upon them at once as they lay and if any were not killed at the first volley and offered to submit we might save them and so put it wholly upon god s providence to direct the shot he said very modestly that he was loath to kill them if he could help it but that those two were incorrigible villains and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship and if they escaped we should be undone still for they would go on board and bring the whole ship s company and destroy us all well then said i necessity legitimates my advice for it is the only way to save our lives however seeing him still cautious of shedding blood i told him they should go themselves and manage as they found convenient in the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake and soon after we saw two of them on their feet i asked him if either of them were the men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny he said no well then said i you may let them escape and providence seems to have wakened them on purpose to save themselves now said i if the rest escape you it is your fault animated with this he took the musket i had given him in his hand and pistol in his belt and his two comrades with him with each man a piece in his hand the two men who were with him going first made some noise at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about and seeing them coming cried out to the rest but it was too late then for the moment he cried out they fired i mean the two men the captain wisely reserving his own piece they had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew that one of them was killed on the spot and the other very much wounded but not being dead he started up on his feet and called eagerly for help to the other but the captain stepping to him told him it was too late to cry for help he should call upon god to forgive his villany and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket so that he never spoke more there were three more in the company and one of them was also slightly wounded by this time i was come and when they saw their danger and that it was in vain to resist they begged for mercy the captain told them he would spare their lives if they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship and afterwards in carrying her back to jamaica from whence they came they gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be desired and he was willing to believe them and spare their lives which i was not against only i obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were upon the island while this was doing i sent friday with the captain s mate to the boat with orders to secure her and bring away the oars and sail which they did and by and by three straggling men that were happily for them parted from the rest came back upon hearing the guns fired and seeing their captain who before was their prisoner now their conqueror they submitted to be bound also and so our victory was complete it now remained that the captain and i should inquire into one another s circumstances i began first and told him my whole history which he heard with an attention even to amazement and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition and indeed as my story is a whole collection of wonders it affected him deeply but when he reflected from thence upon himself and how i seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life the tears ran down his face and he could not speak a word more after this communication was at an end i carried him and his two men into my apartments leading them in just where i came out viz at the top of the house where i refreshed them with such provisions as i had and shewed them all the contrivances i had made during my long long inhabiting that place all i shewed them all i said to them was perfectly amazing but above all the captain admired my fortification and how perfectly i had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees which having now been planted near twenty years and the trees growing much faster than in england was become a little wood and so thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at that one side where i had reserved my little winding passage into it this i told him was my castle and my residence but that i had a seat in the country as most princes have whither i could retreat upon occasion and i would shew him that too another time but at present our business was to consider how to recover the ship he agreed with me as to that but told me he was perfectly at a loss what measure to take for that there were still six and twenty hands on board who having entered into a cursed conspiracy by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law would be hardened in it now by desperation and would carry it on knowing that if they were reduced they should be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to england or to any of the english colonies and that therefore there would be no attacking them with so small a number as we were i mused for some time upon what he had said and found it was a very rational conclusion and that therefore something was to be resolved on very speedily as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise as to prevent their landing upon us and destroying us upon this it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship s crew wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat would certainly come on shore in their other boat to see for them and that then perhaps they might come armed and be too strong for us this he allowed was rational upon this i told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach so that they might not carry her off and taking every thing out of her leaving her so far useless as not to be fit to swim accordingly we went on board took the arms which were left on board out of her and whatever else we found there which was a bottle of brandy and another of rum a few biscuit cakes an horn of powder and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas the sugar was five or six pounds all which was very welcome to me especially the brandy and sugar of which i had had none left for many years when we had carried all these things on shore the oars mast sail and rudder of the boat were carried before as above we knocked a great hole in her bottom that if they had come strong enough to master us yet they could not carry off the boat indeed it was not much in my thoughts that we could be capable to recover the ship but my view was that if they went away without the boat i did not much question to make her fit again to carry us away to the leeward islands and call upon our friends the spaniards in my way for i had them still in my thoughts while we were thus preparing our designs and had first by main strength heaved the boat up upon the beach so high that the tide would not float her off at high water mark and besides had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped and were sat down musing what we should do we heard the ship fire a gun and saw her make a waft with her ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board but no boat stirred and they fired several times making other signals for the boat at last when all their signals and firings proved fruitless and they found the boat did not stir we saw them by the help of our glasses hoist another boat out and row towards the shore and we found as they approached that there were no less than ten men in her and that they had fire arms with them as the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore we had a full view of them as they came and a plain sight of the men even of their faces because the tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat they rowed up under shore to come to the same place where the other had landed and where the boat lay by this means i say we had a full view of them and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat of whom he said that there were three very honest fellows who he was sure were led into this conspiracy by the rest being overpowered and frighted but that for the boatswain who it seems was the chief officer among them and all the rest they were as outrageous as any of the ship s crew and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us i smiled at him and told him that men in our circumstances were past the operations of fear that seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that we were supposed to be in we ought to expect that the consequence whether death or life would be sure to be a deliverance i asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for and where sir said i is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life which elevated you a little while ago for my part said i there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it what s that says he why said i tis that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them which should be spared had they been all of the wicked part of the crew i should have thought god s providence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands for depend upon it every man of them that comes ashore are our own and shall die or live as they behave to us as i spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance i found it greatly encouraged him so we set vigorously to our business we had upon the first appearance of the boat s coming from the ship considered of separating our prisoners and had indeed secured them effectually two of them of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary i sent with friday and one of the three delivered men to my cave where they were remote enough and out of danger of being heard or discovered or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have delivered themselves here they left them bound but gave them provisions and promised them if they continued there quietly to give them their liberty in a day or two but that if they attempted their escape they should be put to death without mercy they promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and a light left them for friday gave them candles such as we made ourselves for their comfort and they did not know but that he stood centinel over them at the entrance the other prisoners had better usage two of them were kept pinioned indeed because the captain was not free to trust them but the other two were taken into my service upon their captain s recommendation and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us so with them and the three honest men we were seven men well armed and i made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were a coming considering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men among them also as soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore hauling the boat up after them which i was glad to see for i was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore with some hands in her to guard her and so we should not be able to seize the boat being on shore the first thing they did they ran all to the other boat and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped as above of all that was in her and a great hole in her bottom after they had mused awhile upon this they set up two or three great shouts hallooing with all their might to try if they could make their companions hear but all was to no purpose then they came all close in a ring and fired a volley of their small arms which indeed we heard and the echoes made the woods ring but it was all one those in the cave we were sure could not hear and those in our keeping though they heard it well enough yet durst give no answer to them they were so astonished at the surprise of this that as they told us afterwards they resolved to go all on board again to their ship and let them know there that the men were all murdered and the long boat staved accordingly they immediately launched the boat again and got all of them on board the captain was terribly amazed and even confounded at this believing they would go on board the ship again and set sail giving their comrades up for lost and so he should still lose the ship which he was in hopes we should have recovered but he was quickly as much frighted the other way they had not been long put off with the boat but we perceived them all coming on shore again but with this new measure in their conduct which it seems they consulted together upon viz to leave three men in the boat and the rest to go on shore and go up into the country to look for their fellows this was a great disappointment to us for now we were at a loss what to do for our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape because they would then row away to the ship and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail and so our recovering the ship would be lost however we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might present the seven men came on shore and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore and came to an anchor to wait for them so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat those that came on shore kept close together marching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay and we could see them plainly though they could not perceive us we could have been very glad they would have come nearer to us so that we might have fired at them or that they would have gone farther off that we might have come abroad but when they were come to the brow of the hill where they could see a great way in the valley and woods which lay towards the north east part and where the island lay lowest they shouted and hallooed till they were weary and not caring it seems to venture far from the shore nor far from one another they sat down together under a tree to consider of it had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there as the other party of them had done they had done the job for us but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep though they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither the captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of theirs viz that perhaps they would all fire a volley again to endeavour to make their fellows hear and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged and they would certainly yield and we should have them without bloodshed i liked the proposal provided it was done while we heard when they were presently stopped by the creek where the water being up they could not get over and called for the boat to come up and set them over as indeed i expected when they had set themselves over i observed that the boat being gone up a good way into the creek and as it were in a harbour within the land they took one of the three men out of her to go along with them and left only two in the boat having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore this was what i wished for and immediately leaving friday and the captain s mate to their business i took the rest with me and crossing the creek out of their sight we surprized the two men before they were aware one of them lying on shore and the other being in the boat the fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking and going to start up the captain who was foremost ran in upon him and knocked him down and then called out to him in the boat to yield or he was a dead man there needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield when he saw five men upon him and his comrade knocked down besides this was it seems one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield but afterwards to join very sincere with us in the mean time friday and the captain s mate so well managed their business with the rest that they drew them by hollowing and answering from one hill to another and from one wood to another till they not only heartily tired them but left them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark and indeed they were heartily tired themselves also by the time they came back to us we had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark and to fall upon them so as to make sure work with them it was several hours after friday came back to me before they came back to their boat and we could hear the foremost of them long before they came quite up calling to those behind to come along and could also hear them answer and complain how lame and tired they were and not being able to come any faster which was very welcome news to us at length they came up to the boat but it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek the tide ebbed out and their two men gone we could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable manner telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted island that either there were inhabitants in it and they should all be murdered or else there were devils or spirits in it and they should be all carried away and devoured they hallooed again and called their two comrades by their names a great many times but no answer after some time we could see them by the little light there was run about wringing their hands like men in despair and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves then come ashore and walk about again and so the same thing over again my men would fain have had me given them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark but i was willing to take them at some advantage so to spare them and kill as few of them as i could and especially i was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men knowing the other men were very well armed i resolved to wait to see if they did not separate and therefore to make sure of them i drew my ambuscade nearer and ordered friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close to the ground as they could that they might not be discovered and get as near them as they could possibly before they offered to fire they had not been long in that posture till the boatswain who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny and had now shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest came walking towards them with two more of the crew the captain was so eager at having the principal rogue so much in his power that he could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him for they only heard his tongue before but when they came nearer the captain and friday starting up on their feet let fly at them the boatswain was killed upon the spot the next man was shot in the body and fell just by him though he did not die till an hour or two after and the third ran for it at the noise of the fire i immediately advanced with my whole army which was now eight men viz myself generalissimo friday my lieutenant general the captain and his two men and the three prisoners of war whom he had trusted with arms we came upon them indeed in the dark so that they could not see our number and i made the man they had left in the boat who was now one of us to call them by name to try if i could bring them to a parley and so might perhaps reduce them to terms which fell out just as we desired for indeed it was easy to think as their condition then was they would be very willing to capitulate so he calls out as loud as he could to one of them tom smith tom smith tom smith answered immediately who s that robinson for it seems he knew his voice the other answered ay ay for god s sake tom smith throw down your arms and yield or you are all dead men this moment who must we yield to where are they says smith again here they are says he here is our captain and fifty men with him have been hunting you this two hours the boatswain is killed will frye is wounded and i am a prisoner and if you do not yield your are all lost will they give us quarter then says tom smith and we will yield i ll go and ask if you promise to yield says robinson so he asked the captain and the captain himself then calls out you smith you know my voice if you lay down your arms immediately and submit you shall have your lives all but will atkins upon this will atkins cried out for god s sake captain give me quarter what have i done they have been all as bad us i which by the way was not true either for it seems this will atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied and used him barbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language however the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion and trust to the governor s mercy by which he meant me for they all called me governor in a word they all laid down their arms and begged their lives and i sent the man that had parleyed with them and two more who bound them all and then my great army of fifty men which particularly with those three were all but eight came up and seized upon them all and upon their boat only that i kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of state our next work was to repair the boat and to think of seizing the ship and as for the captain now he had leisure to parley with them he expostulated with them upon the villany of their practices with him and at length upon the farther wickedness of their design and how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end and perhaps to the gallows they all appeared very penitent and begged hard for their lives as for that he told them they were none of his prisoners but the commander s of the island that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island but it had pleased god so to direct them that the island was inhabited and that the governor was an englishman that he might hang them all there if he pleased but as he had given them all quarter he supposed he would send them to england to be dealt with there as justice required except atkins whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death for that he would be hanged in the morning though this was all a fiction of his own yet it had its desired effect atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his life and all the rest begged of him for god s sake that they might not be sent to england it now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship so i retired in the dark from them that they might not see what kind of a governor they had and called the captain to me when i called as at a good distance one of the men was ordered to speak again and say to the captain captain the commander calls for you and presently the captain replied tell his excellency i am just a coming this more perfectly amused them and they all believed that the commander was just by with his fifty men upon the captain s coming to me i told him my project for seizing the ship which he liked wonderfully well and resolved to put it in execution the next morning but in order to execute it with more art and to be secure of success i told him we must divide the prisoners and that he should go and take atkins and two more of the worst of them and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay this was committed to friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain they conveyed them to the cave as to a prison and it was indeed a dismal place especially to men in their condition the others i ordered to my bower as i called it of which i have given a full description and as it was fenced in and they pinioned the place was secure enough considering they were upon their behaviour to these in the morning i sent the captain who was to enter into a parley with them in a word to try them and tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship he talked to them of the injury done him of the condition they were brought to and that though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present action yet that if they were sent to england they would all be hanged in chains to be sure but that if they would join in such an attempt as to recover the ship he would have the governor s engagement for their pardon any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in their condition they fell down on their knees to the captain and promised with the deepest imprecations that they would be faithful to him to the last drop and that they should owe their lives to him and would go with him all over the world that they would own him for a father to them as long as they lived well says the captain i must go and tell the governor what you say and see what i can do to bring him to consent to it so he brought me an account of the temper he found them in and that he verily believed they would be faithful however that we might be very secure i told him he should go back again and choose out five of them and tell them that they should see that they did not want men but he would take out those five to be his assistants and that the governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle my cave as hostages for the fidelity of those five and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive upon the shore this looked severe and convinced them that the governor was in earnest however they had no way left them but to accept it and it was now the business of the prisoners as much as of the captain to persuade the other five to do their duty our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition 1 the captain his mate and passenger 2 then the two prisoners of the first gang to whom having their characters from the captain i had given their liberty and trusted them with arms 3 the other two whom i kept till now in my bower pinioned but upon the captain s motion had now released 4 these five released at last so that they were twelve in all besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages i asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on board the ship for as for me and my man friday i did not think it was proper for us to stir having seven men left behind and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder and supply them with victuals as to the five in the cave i resolved to keep them fast but friday went twice a day to them to supply them with necessaries and i made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance where friday was to take it when i shewed myself to the two hostages it was with the captain who told them i was the person the governor had ordered to look after them and that it was the governor s pleasure that they should not stir any where but by my direction that if they did they should be fetched into the castle and be laid in irons so that as we never suffered them to see me as governor so i now appeared as another person and spoke of the governor the garrison the castle and the like upon all occasions the captain now had no difficulty before him but to furnish his two boats stop the breach of one and man them he made his passenger captain of one with four other men and himself and his mate and five more went in the other and they contrived their business very well for they came up to the ship about midnight as soon as they came within call of the ship he made robinson hail them and tell them he had brought off the men and the boat but that it was a long time before they had found them and the like holding them in a chat till they came to the ship s side when the captain and the mate entering first with their arms immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the but end of their muskets being very faithfully seconded by their men they seemed all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks and began to fasten the hatches to keep them down who were below when the other boat and their men entering at the fore chains secured the forecastle of the ship and the skuttle which went down into the cook room making three men they found there prisoners when this was done and all safe upon the deck the captain ordered the mate with three men to break into the round house where the new rebel captain lay and having taken the alarm was gotten up and with two men and a boy had gotten fire arms in their hands and when the mate with a crow split upon the door the new captain and his men fired boldly among them and wounded the mate with a musket ball which broke his arm and wounded two more of the men but killed nobody the mate calling for help rushed however into the round house wounded as he was and with his pistol shot the new captain through the head the bullets entering at his mouth and came out again behind one of his ears so that he never spoke a word upon which the rest yielded and the ship was taken effectually without any more lives being lost as soon as the ship was thus secured the captain ordered seven guns to be fired which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success which you may be sure i was very glad to hear having sat watching upon the shore for it till near two of the clock in the morning having thus heard the signal plainly i laid me down and it having been a day of great fatigue to me i slept very sound till i was something surprised with the noise of a gun and presently starting up i heard a man call me by the name of governor governor and presently i knew the captain s voice when climbing up to the top of the hill there he stood and pointing to the ship he embraced me in his arms my dear friend and deliverer says he there s your ship for she is all yours and so are we and all that belong to her i cast my eyes to the ship and there she rode within a little more than half a mile of the shore for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her and the weather being fair had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of a little creek and the tide being up the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where i first landed my rafts and so landed just at my door i was at first ready to sink down with the surprise for i saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands all things easy and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither i pleased to go at first for some time i was not able to answer one word but as he had taken me in his arms i held fast by him or i should have fallen to the ground he perceived the surprise and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial which he had brought on purpose for me after i drank it i sat down upon the ground and though it brought me to myself yet it was a good while before i could speak a word to him all this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as i only not under any surprise as i was and he said a thousand kind tender things to me to compose and bring me to myself but such was the flood of joy in my breast that it put all my spirits into confusion at last it broke into tears and in a little while after i recovered my speech then i took my turn and embraced him as my deliverer and we rejoiced together i told him i looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to deliver me and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of providence governing the world and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite power could search into the remotest corner of the world and send help to the miserable whenever he pleased i forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to heaven and what heart could forbear to bless him who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for one in such a wilderness and in such a desolate condition but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed when we had talked awhile the captain told me he had brought me some little refreshments such as the ship afforded and such as the wretches who had been so long his masters had not plundered him of upon this he called aloud to the boat and bids his men bring the things ashore that were for the governor and indeed it was a present as if i had been one not that i was to be carried along with them but as if i had been to dwell upon the island still and they were to go without me first he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters six large bottles of madeira wine the bottles held two quarts apiece two pounds of excellent good tobacco twelve good pieces of the ship s beef and six pieces of pork with a bag of peas and about a hundred weight of biscuit he brought me also a box of sugar a box of flour a bag full of lemons and two bottles of lime juice and abundance of other things but besides these and what was a thousand times more useful to me he brought me six clean new shirts six very good neckcloths two pair of gloves one pair of shoes a hat and one pair of stockings and a very good suit of clothes of his own which had been worn but very little in a word he clothed me from head to foot it was a very kind and agreeable present as any one may imagine to one in my circumstances but never was any thing in the world of that kind so unpleasant awkward and uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at their first putting on after these ceremonies passed and after all his things were brought into my little apartment we began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had for it was worth considering whether we might venture to take them away with us or no especially two of them whom we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree and the captain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them and if he did carry them away it must he in irons as malefactors to be delivered over to justice at the first english colony he could come at and i found that the captain himself was very anxious about it upon this i told him that if he desired it i durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make their own request that he should leave them upon the island i should be very glad of that says the captain with all my heart well said i i will send for them and talk with them for you so i caused friday and the two hostages for they were now discharged their comrades having performed their promise i say i caused them to go to the cave and bring up the five men pinioned as they were to the bower and keep them there till i came after some time i came thither dressed in my new habit and now i was called governor again being all met and the captain with me i caused the men to be brought before me and i told them i had had a full account of their villanous behaviour to the captain and how they had run away with the ship and were preparing to commit farther robberies but that providence had ensnared them in their own ways and that they were fallen into the pit which they had digged for others i let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized that she lay now in the road and they might see by and by that their new captain had received the reward of his villany for that they might see him hanging at the yard arm that as to them i wanted to know what they had to say why i should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact as by my commission they could not doubt i had authority to do one of them answered in the name of the rest that they had nothing to say but this that when they were taken the captain promised them their lives and they humbly implored my mercy but i told them i knew not what mercy to shew them for as for myself i had resolved to quit the island with all my men and had taken passage with the captain to go for england and as for the captain he could not carry them to england other than as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny and running away with the ship the consequence of which they must needs know would be the gallows so that i could not tell which was best for them unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island if they desired that i did not care as i had liberty to leave it i had some inclination to give them their lives if they thought they could shift on shore they seemed very thankful for it said they would much rather venture to stay there than to be carried to england to be hanged so i left it on that issue however the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it as if he durst not leave them there upon this i seemed to be a little angry with the captain and told him that they were my prisoners not his and that seeing i had offered them so much favour i would be as good as my word and that if he did not think fit to consent to it i would set them at liberty as i found them and if he did not like that he might take them again if he could catch them upon this they appeared very thankful and i accordingly set them at liberty and bade them retire into the woods to the place whence they came and i would leave them some fire arms some ammunition and some directions how they should live very well if they thought fit upon this i prepared to go on board the ship but told the captain that i would stay that night to prepare my things and desired him to go on board in the meantime and keep all right in the ship and send the boat on shore the next day for me ordering him in the meantime to cause the new captain who was killed to be hanged at the yard arm that these men might see him when the captain was gone i sent for the men up to me to my apartment and entered seriously into discourse with them of their circumstances i told them i thought they had made a right choice that if the captain carried them away they would certainly be hanged i shewed them their captain hanging at the yard arm of the ship and told them they had nothing less to expect when they had all declared their willingness to stay i then told them i would let them into the story of my living there and put them into the way of making it easy to them accordingly i gave them the whole history of the place and of my coming to it shewed them my fortifications the way i made my bread planted my corn cured my grapes and in a word all that was necessary to make them easy i told them the story of the sixteen spaniards that were to be expected for whom i left a letter and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves i left them my fire arms viz five muskets three fowling pieces and three swords i had about a barrel of powder left for after the first year or two i used but little and wasted none i gave them a description of the way i managed the goats and directions to milk and fatten them to make both butter and cheese in a word i gave them every part of my own story and i told them i would prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more and some garden seed which i told them i would have been very glad of also i gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat and bade them be sure to sow and increase them having done all this i left them the next day and went on board the ship we prepared immediately to sail but did not weigh that night the next morning early two of the five men came swimming to the ship s side and making a most lamentable complaint of the other three begged to be taken into the ship for god s sake for they should be murdered and begged the captain to take them on board though he hanged them immediately upon this the captain pretended to have no power without me but after some difficulty and after their solemn promises of amendment they were taken on board and were some time after soundly whipped and pickled after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows some time after this i went with the boat on shore the tide being up with the things promised to the men to which the captain at my intercession caused their chests and clothes to be added which they took and were very thankful for i also encouraged them by telling them that if it lay in my way to send a vessel to take them in i would not forget them when i took leave of this island i carried on board for relics the great goat skin cap i had made my umbrella and one of my parrots also i forgot not to take the money i formerly mentioned which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled and also the money i found in the wreck of the spanish ship and thus i left the island the nineteenth of december as i found by the ship s account in the year 1686 after i had been upon it eight and twenty years two months and nineteen days being delivered from the second captivity the same day of the month that i first made my escape in the barco longo from among the moors of sallee in this vessel after a long voyage i arrived in england the eleventh of june in the year 1687 having been thirty and five years absent when i came to england i was a perfect stranger to all the world as if i had never been known there my benefactor and faithful steward whom i had left in trust with my money was alive but had had great misfortunes in the world was become a widow the second time and very low in the world i made her easy as to what she owed me assuring her i would give her no trouble but on the contrary in gratitude to her former care and faithfulness to me i relieved her as my little stock would afford which at that time would indeed allow me to do but little for her but i assured her i would never forget her former kindness to me nor did i forget her when i had sufficient to help her as shall be observed in its place i went down afterwards into yorkshire but my father was dead and my mother and all the family extinct except that i found two sisters and two of the children of one of my brothers and as i had been long ago given over for dead there had been no provision made for me so that in a word i found nothing to relieve or assist me and that little money i had would not do much for me as to settling in the world i met with one piece of gratitude indeed which i did not expect and this was that the master of the ship whom i had so happily delivered and by the same means saved the ship and cargo having given a very handsome account to the owners of the manner how i had saved the lives of the men and the ship they invited me to meet them and some other merchants concerned and all together made me a very handsome compliment upon that subject and a present of almost two hundred pounds sterling but after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world i resolved to go to lisbon and see if i might not come by some information of the state of my plantation in the brasils and what was become of my partner who i had reason to suppose had some years now given me over for dead with this view i took shipping for lisbon where i arrived in april following my man friday accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings and proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions when i came to lisbon i found out by inquiry and to my particular satisfaction my old friend the captain of the ship who first took me up at sea off the shore of africa he was now grown old and had left off the sea having put his son who was far from a young man into his ship and who still used the brasil trade the old man did not know me and indeed i hardly knew him but i soon brought myself to his remembrance when i told him who i was after some passionate expressions of our old acquaintance i inquired you may be sure after my plantation and my partner the old man told me he had not been in the brasils for about nine years but that he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living but the trustees whom i had joined with him to take cognizance of my part were both dead that however he believed that i would have a very good account of the improvement of the plantation for that upon the general belief of my being cast away and drowned my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator fiscal who had appropriated it in case i never came to claim it one third to the king and two thirds to the monastery of st augustine to be expended for the benefit of the poor and for the conversion of the indians to the catholic faith but that if i appeared or any one for me to claim the inheritance it would be restored only that the improvement or annual production being distributed to charitable uses could not be restored but he assured me that the steward of the king s revenue from lands and the provedore or steward of the monastery had taken great care all along that the incumbent that is to say my partner gave every year a faithful account of the produce of which they received duly my moiety i asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought the plantation and whether he thought it might be worth looking after or whether on my going thither i should meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety he told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved but this he knew that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half of it and that to the best of his remembrance he had heard that the king s third of my part which was it seems granted away to some other monastery or religious house amounted to above two hundred moidores a year that as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it there was no question to be made of that my partner being alive to witness my title and my name being also enrolled in the register of the county also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair honest people and very wealthy and he believed i would not only have their assistance for putting me in possession but would find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account being the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust and before it was given up as above which as he remembered was about twelve years i shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects when he knew that i had made my will and had made him the portuguese captain my universal heir c he told me that was true but that as there was no proof of my being dead he could not act as executor until some certain account should come of my death and that besides he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote that it was true he had registered my will and put in his claim and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive he would have acted by procuration and taken possession of the ingenio so they called the sugarhouse and had given his son who was now at the brasils order to do it but says the old man i have one piece of news to tell you which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest and that is that believing you were lost and all the world believing so also your partner and trustees did offer to account to me in your name for six or eight of the first years of profit which i received but there being at that time says he great disbursements for increasing the works building an ingenio and buying slaves it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced however says the old man i shall give you a true account of what i have received in all and how i have disposed of it after a few days farther conference with this ancient friend be brought me an account of the six first years income of my plantation signed by my partner and the merchants trustees being always delivered in goods viz tobacco in roll and sugar in chests besides rum molasses c which is the consequence of a sugar work and i found by this account that every year the income considerably increased but as above the disbursement being large the sum at first was small however the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of tobacco which were lost in his ship he having been shipwrecked coming home to lisbon about eleven years after my leaving the place the good man then began to complain of his misfortunes and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses and buy him a share in a new ship however my old friend says he you shall not want a supply in your necessity and as soon as my son returns you shall be fully satisfied upon this he pulls out an old pouch and gives me two hundred portugal moidores in gold and giving me the writings of his title to the ship which his son was gone to the brasils in of which he was a quarter part owner and his son another he puts them both in my hands for security of the rest i was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be able to bear this and remembering what he had done for me how he had taken me up at sea and how generously he had used me on all occasions and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me i could hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me therefore first i asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time and if it would not straiten him he told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little but however it was my money and i might want it more than he every thing the good man said was full of affection and i could hardly refrain from tears while he spake in short i took one hundred of the moidores and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them then i returned him the rest and told him if ever i had possession of the plantation i would return the other to him also as indeed i afterwards did and then as to the bill of sale of his part in his son s ship i would not take it by any means but that if i wanted the money i found he was honest enough to pay me and if i did not but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect i would never have a penny more from him when this was past the old man began to ask me if he should put me in a method to make my claim to my plantation i told him i thought to go over to it myself he said i might do so if i pleased but that if i did not there were ways enough to secure my right and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use and as there were ships in the river of lisbon just ready to go away to brasil he made me enter my name in a public register with his affidavit affirming upon oath that i was alive and that i was the same person who took up the land for the planting the said plantation at first this being regularly attested by a notary and the procuration affixed he directed me to send it with a letter of his writing to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place and then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return never any thing was more honourable than the proceedings upon this procuration for in less than seven months i received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees the merchants on whose account i went to sea in which were the following particular letters and papers enclosed first there was the account current of the produce of my farm or plantation from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old portugal captain being for six years the balance appeared to be 1171 moidores in my favour secondly there was the account of four years more while they kept the effects in their hands before the government claimed the administration as being the effects of a person not to be found which they call civil death and the balance of this the value of plantation increasing amounted to crusadoes which made 3241 moidores thirdly there was the prior of the augustines account who had received the profits for above fourteen years but not being able to account for what was disposed to the hospital very honestly declared he had 872 moidores not distributed which he acknowledged to my account as to the king s part that refunded nothing there was also a letter of my partner s congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive giving me an account how the estate was improved and what it produced a year with a particular of the number of squares or acres that it contained how planted how many slaves there were upon it and making two and twenty crosses for blessings told me he had said so many ave marias to thank the blessed virgin that i was alive inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of my own and in the mean time to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects if i did not come my self concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship and that of his family and sent me as a present seven fine leopard s skins which he had it seems received from africa by some other ship which he had sent thither and who it seems had made a better voyage than i he sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats and an hundred pieces of gold uncoined not quite so large as moidores by the same fleet my two merchant trustees shipped me 1 200 chests of sugar 800 rolls of tobacco and the rest of the whole account in gold i might well say now indeed that the latter end of job was better than the beginning it is impossible to express here the flutterings of my very heart when i looked over these letters and especially when i found all my wealth about me for as the brasil ships come all in fleets the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand in a word i turned pale and grew sick and had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial i believe the sudden surprize of joy had overset nature and i had died upon the spot nay after that i continued very ill and was so some hours till a physician being sent for and something of the real cause of my illness being known he ordered me to be let blood after which i had relief and grew well but i verily believe if it had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits i should have died i was now master all on a sudden of above 5000 l sterling in money and had an estate as i might well call it in the brasils of above a thousand pounds a year as sure as an estate of lands in england and in a word i was in a condition which i scarce knew how to understand or how to compose my self for the enjoyment of it the first thing i did was to recompense my original benefactor my good old captain who had been first charitable to me in my distress kind to me in my beginning and honest to me at the end i shewed him all that was sent me i told him that next to the providence of heaven which disposes all things it was owing to him and that it now lay on me to reward him which i would do a hundred fold so i first returned to him the hundred moidores i had received of him then i sent for a notary and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge for the 470 moidores which he had acknowledged he owed me in the fullest and firmest manner possible after which i caused a procuration to be drawn impowering him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my plantation and appointing my partner to account to him and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my name and a clause in the end being a grant of 100 moidores a year to him during his life out of the effects and 50 moidores a year to his son after him for his life and thus i requited my old man i was now to consider which way to steer my course next and what to do with the estate that providence had thus put into my hands and indeed i had more care upon my head now than i had in my silent state of life in the island where i wanted nothing but what i had and had nothing but what i wanted whereas i had now a great charge upon me and my business was how to secure it i had ne er a cave now to hide my money in or a place where it might lie without lock or key till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body would meddle with it on the contrary i knew not where to put it or who to trust with it my old patron the captain indeed was honest and that was the only refuge i had in the next place my interest in the brasils seemed to summon me thither but now i could not tell how to think of going thither till i had settled my affairs and left my effects in some safe hands behind me at first i thought of my old friend the widow who i knew was honest and would be just to me but then she was in years and but poor and for ought i knew might be in debt so that in a word i had no way but to go back to england my self and take my effects with me it was some months however before i resolved upon this and therefore as i had rewarded the old captain fully and to his satisfaction who had been my former benefactor so i began to think of my poor widow whose husband had been my first benefactor and she while it was in her power my faithful steward and instructor so the first thing i did i got a merchant in lisbon to write to his correspondent in london not only to pay a bill but to go find her out and carry her in money an hundred pounds from me and to talk with her and comfort her in her poverty by telling her she should if i lived have a further supply at the same time i sent my two sisters in the country each of them an hundred pounds they being though not in want yet not in very good circumstances one having been married and left a widow and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be but among all my relations or acquaintances i could not yet pitch upon one to whom i durst commit the gross of my stock that i might go away to the brasils and leave things safe behind me and this greatly perplexed me i had once a mind to have gone to the brasils and have settled my self there for i was as it were naturalized to the place but i had some little scruple in my mind about religion which insensibly drew me back of which i shall say more presently however it was not religion that kept me from going thither for the present and as i had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of the country all the while i was among them so neither did i yet only that now and then having of late thought more of it than formerly when i began to think of living and dying among them i began to regret my having professed myself a papist and thought it might not be the best religion to die in but as i have said this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the brasils but that really i did not know with whom to leave my effects behind me so i resolved at last to go to england with them where if i arrived i concluded i should make some acquaintance or find some relations that would be faithful to me and accordingly i prepared to go for england with all my wealth in order to prepare things for my going home i first the brasil fleet being just going away resolved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account of things i had from thence and first to the prior of st augustine i wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy two moidores which was undisposed of which i desired might be given five hundred to the monastery and three hundred and seventy two to the poor as the prior should direct desiring the good padre s prayers for me and the like i wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for as for sending them any present they were far above having any occasion of it lastly i wrote to my partner acknowledging his industry in the improving the plantation and his integrity in increasing the stock of the works giving him instructions for his future government of my part according to the powers i had left with my old patron to whom i desired him to send whatever became due to me till he should hear from me more particularly assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to him but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life to this i added a very handsome present of some italian silks for his wife and two daughters for such the captain s son informed me he had with two pieces of fine english broad cloth the best i could get in lisbon five pieces of black bays and some flanders lace of a good value having thus settled my affairs sold my cargo and turned all my effects into good bills of exchange my next difficulty was which way to go to england i had been accustomed enough to the sea and yet i had a strange aversion to go to england by sea at that time and though i could give no reason for it yet the difficulty increased upon me so much that though i had once shipped my baggage in order to go yet i altered my mind and that not once but two or three times it is true i had been very unfortunate by sea and this might be one of the reasons but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment two of the ships which i had singled out to go in i mean more particularly singled out than any other that is to say so as in one of them to put my things on board and in the other to have agreed with the captain i say two of these ships miscarried viz one was taken by the algerines and the other was cast away on the start near torbay and all the people drowned except three so that in either of those vessels i had been made miserable and in which most it was hard to say having been thus harassed in my thoughts my old pilot to whom i communicated every thing pressed me earnestly not to go to sea but either to go by land to the groyne and cross over the bay of biscay to rochelle from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to paris and so to calais and dover or to go up to madrid and so all the way by land through france in a word i was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all except from calais to dover that i resolved to travel all the way by land which as i was not in haste and did not value the charge was by much the pleasanter way and to make it more so my old captain brought an english gentleman the son of a merchant in lisbon who was willing to travel with me after which we picked up two who were english and merchants also and two young portuguese gentlemen the last going to paris only so that we were in all six of us and five servants the two merchants and the two portuguese contenting themselves with one servant between two to save the charge and as for me i got an english sailor to travel with me as a servant besides my man friday who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant upon the road in this manner i set out from lisbon and our company being all very well mounted and armed we made a little troop whereof they did me the honour to call me captain as well because i was the oldest man as because i had two servants and indeed was the original of the whole journey as i have troubled you with none of my sea journals so shall i trouble you with none of my land journals but some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey i must not omit when we came to madrid we being all of us strangers to spain were willing to stay some time to sec the court of spain and to see what was worth observing but it being the latter part of the summer we hastened away and set out from madrid about the middle of october but when we came to the edge of navarre we were alarmed at several towns on the way with an account that so much snow was fallen on the french side of the mountains that several travellers were obliged to come back to pampeluna after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on when we came to pampeluna itself we found it so indeed and to me that had been always used to a hot climate and indeed to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes on the cold was insufferable nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising to come but ten days before out of the old castile where the weather was not only warm but very hot and immediately to feel a wind from the pyrenees mountains so very keen so severely cold as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes was very strange poor friday was really frighted when he saw the mountains all covered with snow and felt cold weather which he had never seen or felt before in his life to mend the matter after we came to pampeluna it continued snowing with so much violence and so long that the people said winter was come before its time and the roads which were difficult before were now quite impassable in a word the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel and being not hard frozen as is the case in northern countries there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every step we staid no less than twenty days at pampeluna when seeing the winter coming on and no likelihood of its being better for it was the severest winter all over europe that had been known in many years proposed that we should all go away to fontarabia and there take shipping for boardeaux which was a very little voyage but while we were considering this there came in four french gentlemen who having been stopped on the french side of the passes as we were on the spanish had found out a guide who traversing the country near the head of languedoc had brought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow and where they met with snow in any quantity they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses we sent for this guide who told us he would undertake to carry us the same way with no hazard from the snow provided we were armed sufficiently to protect us from wild beasts for he said upon these great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains being made ravenous for want of food the ground being covered with snow we told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were if he would ensure us from a kind of two legged wolves which we were told we were in most danger from especially on the french side of the mountains he satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go so we readily agreed to follow him as did also twelve other gentlemen with their servants some french some spanish who as i said had attempted to go and were obliged to come back again accordingly we all set out from pampeluna with our guide on the fifteenth of november and indeed i was surprised when instead of going forward he came directly back with us on the same road that we came from madrid above twenty miles when having passed two rivers and come into the plain country we found ourselves in a warm climate again where the country was pleasant and no snow to be seen but on a sudden turning to the left he approached the mountains another way and though it is true the hills and the precipices looked dreadfully yet he made so many tours such meanders and led us by such winding ways we insensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the snow and all on a sudden he shewed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of languedoc and gascoigne all green and flourishing though indeed they were at a great distance and we had some rough way to pass yet we were a little uneasy however when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel but he bid us be easy we should soon be past it all we found indeed that we began to descend every day and to come more north than before and so depending upon our guide we went on it was about two hours before night when our guide being something before us and not just in sight out rushed three monstrous wolves and after them a bear out of a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood two of the wolves flew upon the guide and had he been half a mile before us he had been devoured indeed before we could have helped him one of them fastened upon his horse and the other attacked the man with that violence that he had not time or not presence of mind enough to draw his pistol but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily my man friday being next to me i bid him ride up and see what was the matter as soon as friday came in sight of the man he hallooed as loud as the other o master o master but like a bold fellow rode directly up to the man and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the head it was happy for the poor man that it was my man friday for he having been used to that kind of creature in his country had no fear upon him but went close up to him and shot him as above whereas any of us would have fired at a farther distance and have perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man but it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than i and indeed it alarmed all our company when with the noise of friday s pistol we heard on both sides the dismallest howlings of wolves and the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of them and perhaps indeed there was not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehensions however as friday had killed this wolf the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately and fled having happily fastened upon his head where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth so that he had not done him much hurt the man indeed was most hurt for the raging creature had bit him twice once on the arm and the other time a little above his knee and he was just as it were tumbling down by the disorder of the horse when friday came up and shot the wolf it is easy to suppose that at the noise of friday s pistol we all mended our pace and rid up as fast as the way which was very difficult would give us leave to see what was the matter as soon as we came clear of the trees which blinded us before we saw plainly what had been the case and how friday had disengaged the poor guide though we did not presently discern wind kind of creature it was he had killed but never was a fight managed so hardily and in such a surprising manner as that which followed between friday and the bear which gave us all though at first we were surprised and afraid for him the greatest diversion imaginable as the bear is a heavy clumsy creature and does not gallop as the wolf does which is swift and light so he has two particular qualities which generally are the rule of his actions first as to men who are not his proper prey i say not his proper prey because though i can t say what excessive hunger might do which was now their case the ground being all covered with snow yet as to men he does not usually attempt them unless they first attack him on the contrary if you meet him in the woods if you don t meddle with him he won t meddle with you yet then you must take care to be very civil to him and give him the road for he is a very nice gentleman he won t go a step out of the way for a prince nay if you are really afraid your best way is to look another way and keep going on for sometimes if you stop and stand still and look steadfastly at him he takes it for an affront and if you throw or toss any thing at him and it hits him though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger he takes it for an affront and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge for he will have satisfaction in point of honour and this is his first quality the next is that if he be once affronted he will never leave you night or day till he has his revenge but follow at a good round rate till he overtakes you my man friday had delivered our guide and when we came up to him he was helping him off from his horse for the man was both hurt and frighted and indeed the last more than the first when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood and a very monstrous one it was the biggest by far that ever i saw we were all a little surprised when we saw him but when friday saw him it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow s countenance o o o says friday three times pointing to him o master you give me te leave me shakee te hand with him me makee you good laugh i was surprised to see the fellow so pleased you fool you said i he will eat you up eatee me up eatee me up says friday twice over again me eatee him up me make you good laugh you all stay here me shew you good laugh so down he sits and gets his boots off in a moment and put on a pair of pumps as we call the flat shoes they wear and which he had in his pocket and gives my other servant his horse and with his gun away he flew swift like the wind the bear was walking softly on and offered to meddle with nobody till friday coming pretty near calls to him as if the bear could understand him hark ye hark ye says friday me speakee wit you we followed at a distance for now being come down to the gascoigne side of the mountains we were entered a vast great forest where the country was plain and pretty open though many trees in it scattered here and there friday who had as we say the heels of the bear came up with him quickly and takes up a great stone and throws at him and hit him just on the head but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall but it answered friday s end for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him and shew us some laugh as he called it as soon as the bear felt the stone and saw him he turns about and comes after him taking devilish long strides and strolling along at a strange rate so as he would put a horse to a middling gallop away runs friday and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear and deliver my man though i was angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us when he was going about his own business another way and especially i was angry that he had turned the bear upon us and then run away and i called out you dog said i is this your making us laugh come away and take your horse that we may shoot the creature he hears me and cries out no shoot no shoot stand still you get much laugh and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast s one he turned on a sudden on one side of us and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose he beckoned us to follow and doubling his pace he gets nimbly up the tree laying his gun down upon the ground at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree the bear soon came to the tree and we followed at a distance the first thing he did he stopped at the gun smelt to it but let it lie and up he scrambles into the tree climbing like a cat though so monstrous heavy i was amazed at the folly as i thought it of my man and could not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet till seeing the bear get up the tree we all rode nearer to him when we came to the tree there was friday got out to the small of a large limb of the tree and the bear got about half way to him as soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker ha says he to us now you see me teachee the bear dance so he falls a jumping and shaking the bough at which the bear began to totter but stood still and began to look behind him to see how he should get back then indeed we did laugh heartily but friday had not done with him by a great deal when he sees him stand still he calls out to him again as if he had supposed the bear could speak english what you come no farther pray you come farther so he left jumping and shaking the bough and the bear just as if he understood what he said did come a little farther then he fell a jumping again and the bear stopped again we thought now was a good time to knock him on the head and called to friday to stand still and we would shoot the bear but he cried out earnestly o pray o pray no shoot me shoot by and then he would have said by and by however to shorten the story friday danced so much and the bear stood so ticklish that we had laughing enough indeed but still could not imagine what the fellow would do for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off and we found the bear was too cunning for that too for he would not get out far enough to be thrown down but clings fast with his great broad claws and feet so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it and where the jest would be at last but friday put us out of doubt quickly for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther well well said friday you no come farther me go me go you no come to me me come to you and upon this he goes out to the smallest end of the bough where it would bend with his weight and gently lets himself down by it sliding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet and away he ran to his gun takes it up and stands still well said i to him friday what will you do now why don t you shoot him no shoot says friday no yet me shoot now me no kill me stay give you one more laugh and indeed so he did as you will see presently for when the bear saw his enemy gone he comes back from the bough where he stood but did it mighty leisurely looking behind him every step and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree then with the same hinder end foremost he came down the tree grasping it with his claws and moving one foot at a time very leisurely at this juncture and just before he could set his hind feet upon the ground friday stepped close to him clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear and shot him as dead as a stone then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh and when he saw we were pleased by our looks he falls a laughing himself very loud so we kill bear in my country says friday so you kill them said i why you have no guns no says he no guns but shoot great much long arrow this was indeed a good diversion to us but we were still in a wild place and our guide very much hurt and what to do we hardly knew the howling of wolves ran much in my head and indeed except the noise i once heard on the shore of africa of which i have said something already i never heard any thing that filled me with so much horror these things and the approach of night called us off or else as friday would have had us we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off which was worth saving but we had three leagues to go and our guide hastened us so we left him and went forward on our journey the ground was still covered with snow though not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains and the ravenous creatures as we heard afterwards were come down into the forest and plain country pressed by hunger to seek for food and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages where they surprised the country people killed a great many of their sheep and horses and some people too we had one dangerous place to pass of which our guide told us if there were any more wolves in the country we should find them there and this was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side and a long narrow defile or lane which we were to pass to get through the wood and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge it was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first wood and a little after sunset when we came into the plain we met with nothing in the first wood except that in a little plain within the wood which was not above two furlongs over we saw five great wolves cross the road full speed one after another as if they had been in chase of some prey and had it in view they took no notice of us and were gone and out of sight in a few moments upon this our guide who by the way was a wretched faint hearted fellow bade us keep in a ready posture for he believed there were more wolves a coming we kept our arms ready and our eyes about us but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood which was near half a league and entered the plain as soon as we came into the plain we had occasion enough to look about us the first object we met with was a dead horse that is to say a poor horse which the wolves had killed and at least a dozen of them at work we could not say eating of him but picking of his bones rather for they had eaten up all the flesh before we did not think fit to disturb them at their feast neither did they take much notice of us friday would have let fly at them but i would not suffer him by any means for i found we were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware of we were not half gone over the plain but we began to hear the wolves howl in the woods on our left in a frightful manner and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us all in a body and most of them in a line as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers i scarce knew in what manner to receive them but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only way so we formed in a moment but that we might not have too much interval i ordered that only every other man should fire and that the others who had not fired should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately if they continued to advance upon us and that then those who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusils again but stand ready with every one a pistol for we were all armed with a fusil and a pair of pistols each man so we were by this method able to fire six vollies half of us at a time however at present we had no necessity for upon firing the first volley the enemy made a full stop being terrified as well with the noise as with the fire four of them being shot in the head dropped several others were wounded and went bleeding off as we could see by the snow i found they stopped but did not immediately retreat whereupon remembering that i had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man i caused all our company to halloo as loud as we could and i found the notion not altogether mistaken for upon our shout they began to retire and turn about then i ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear which put them to the gallop and away they went to the woods this gave us leisure to charge our pieces again and that we might lose no time we kept doing but we had but little more than loaded our fusils and put ourselves into a readiness when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left only that it was farther onward the same way we were to go the night was coming on and the night began to be dusky which made it the worse on our side but the noise increasing we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures and on a sudden we perceived two or three troops of wolves on our left one behind us and one on our front so that we seemed to be surrounded with them however as they did not fall upon us we kept our way forward as fast as we could make our horses go which the way being very rough was only a good large trot and in this manner we only came in view of the entrance of the wood through which we were to pass at the farther side of the plain but we were greatly surprised when coming near the lane or pass we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance on a sudden at another opening of the wood we heard the noise of a gun and looking that way out rushed a horse with a saddle and a bridle on him flying like the wind and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him full speed indeed the horse had the heels of them but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate we doubted not but they would get up with him at last and no question but they did here we had a most horrible sight for riding up to the entrance where the horse came out we found the carcass of another horse and of two men devoured by these ravenous creatures and of one the man was no doubt the same whom we heard fire a gun for there lay a gun just by him fired off but as to the man his head and the upper part of his body were eaten up this filled us with horror and we knew not what course to take but the creatures resolved us soon for they gathered about us presently in hopes of prey and i verily believe there were three hundred of them it happened very much to our advantage that at the entrance into the wood but a little way from it there by some large timber trees which had been cut down the summer before and i suppose lay there for carriage i drew my little troop in among these trees and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree i advised them all to alight and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork to stand in a triangle or three fronts enclosing our horses in the centre we did so and it was well we did for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place they came on us with a growling kind of a noise and mounted the piece of timber which as i said was our breastwork as if they were only rushing upon their prey and this fury of theirs it seems was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us which was the prey they aimed at i ordered our men to fire as before every man and they took their aim so sure that indeed they killed several of the wolves at the first volley but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing for they came on like devils those behind pushing on those before when we had fired our second volley of fusils we thought they stopped a little and i hoped they would have gone off but it was but a moment for others came forward again so we fired our vollies of pistols and i believe in these four firings we killed seventeen or eighteen of them and lamed twice as many yet they came on again i was loath to spend our last shot too hastily so i called my servant not my man friday for he was better employed for with the greatest dexterity imaginable he charged my fusil and his own while we were engaged but as i said i called my other man and giving him a horn of powder i bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber and let it be a large train he did so and had but time to get away when the wolves came up to it and some were got up upon it when i snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder set it on fire and those that were upon the timber were scorched with it and six or seven of them fell or rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire we dispatched these in an instant and the rest were so frighted with the light which the night for now it was very near dark made more terrible that they drew back a little upon which i ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley and after that we gave a shout upon this the wolves turned tail and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones which we found struggling on the ground and fell a cutting them with our swords which answered our expectation for the crying and howling they made were better understood by their fellows so that they fled and left us we had first and last killed about three score of them and had it been daylight we had killed many more the field of battle being thus cleared we made forward again for we had still near a league to go we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them but the snow dazzling our eyes we were not certain so in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms for it seems that the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into that village and put them in a terrible fright and they were obliged to keep guard night and day but especially in the night to preserve their cattle and indeed their people the next morning our guide was so ill and his limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds that he could go no farther so we were obliged to take a new guide there and go to tholouse where we found a warm climate a fruitful pleasant country and no snow no wolves or any thing like them but when we told our story at tholouse they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains especially when the snow lay on the ground but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had gotten that would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season and told us it was very much we were not all devoured when we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle they blamed us exceedingly and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed for it was the sight of the horses that made the wolves so furious seeing their prey and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun but they being excessive hungry and raging on that account the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger and that if we had not by the continued fire and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder mastered them it had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces whereas had we been content to have sat still on horseback and fired as horsemen they would not have taken the horses so much for their own when men were on their backs as otherwise and withal they told us that at last if we had stood all together and left our horses they would have been so eager to have devoured them that we might have come off safe especially having our fire arms in our hands and being so many in number for my part i was never so sensible of danger in my life for seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open mouthed to devour us and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to i gave myself over for lost and as it was i believe i shall never care to cross those mountains again i think i would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea though i were sure to meet with a storm once a week i have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through france nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with much more advantage than i can i travelled from tholouse to paris and without any considerable stay came to calais and landed safe at dover the fourteenth of january after having had a severe cold season to travel in i was now come to the centre of my travels and had in a little time all my new discovered estate safe about me the bills of exchange which i brought with me having been very currently paid my principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient widow who in gratitude for the money i had sent her thought no pains too much or care too great to employ for me and i trusted her so entirely with every thing that i was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects and indeed i was very happy from my beginning and now to the end in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman and now i began to think of leaving my effects with this woman and setting out for lisbon and so to the brasils but now another scruple came in the way and that was religion for as i had entertained some doubts about the roman religion even while i was abroad especially in my state of solitude so i knew there was no going to the brasils for me much less going to settle there unless i resolved to embrace the roman catholic religion without any reserve except on the other hand i resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles be a martyr for religion and die in the inquisition so i resolved to stay at home and if i could find means for it to dispose of my plantation to this purpose i wrote to my old friend at lisbon who in return gave me notice that he could easily dispose of it there but that if i thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants the survivors of my trustees who lived in the brasils who must fully understand the value of it who lived just upon the spot and who i knew to be very rich so that he believed they would be fond of buying it he did not doubt but i should make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the more of it accordingly i agreed gave him orders to offer it to them and he did so and in about eight months more the ship being then returned he sent me an account that they had accepted the offer and had remitted 33 000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at lisbon to pay for it in return i signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent from lisbon and sent it to my old man who sent me the bills of exchange for 32 800 pieces of eight for the estate reserving the payment of 100 moidores a year to him the old man during his life and 50 moidores afterwards to his son for his life which i had promised them and which the plantation was to make good as a rent charge and thus i have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure a life of providence s chequer work and of a variety which the world will seldom be able to shew the like of beginning foolishly but closing much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave to much as to hope for any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune i was past running any more hazards and so indeed i had been if other circumstances had concurred but i was inured to a wandering life had no family nor many relations nor however rich had i contracted much acquaintance and though i had sold my estate in the brasils yet i could not keep that country out of my head and had a great mind to be upon the wing again especially i could not resist the strong inclination i had to see my island and to know if the poor spaniards were in being there and how the rogues i left there had used them my true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me from it and so far prevailed with me that almost for seven years she prevented my running abroad during which time i took my two nephews the children of one of my brothers into my care the eldest having something of his own i bred up as a gentleman and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate after my decease the other i put out to a captain of a ship and after five years finding him a sensible bold enterprising young fellow i put him into a good ship and sent him to sea and this young fellow afterwards drew me in as old as i was to farther adventures myself in the meantime i in part settled myself here for first of all i married and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction and had three children two sons and one daughter but my wife dying and my nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to spain my inclination to go abroad and his importunity prevailed and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the east indies this in the year 1694 in this voyage i visited my new colony in the island saw my successors the spaniards had the whole story of their lives and of the villains i left there how at first they insulted the poor spaniards how they afterwards agreed disagreed united separated and how at last the spaniards were obliged to use violence with them how they were subjected to the spaniards how honestly the spaniards used them an history if it were entered into as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part particularly also as to their battles with the caribbeans who landed several times upon the island and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself and how five of them made an attempt upon the main land and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners by which at my coming i found about twenty young children on the island here i stayed about twenty days left them supplies of all necessary things and particularly of arms powder shot clothes tools and two workmen which i brought from england with me viz a carpenter and a smith besides this i shared the lands into parts with them reserved to myself the property of the whole but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed on and having settled all things with them and engaged them not to leave the place i left them there from thence i touched at the brasils from whence i sent a bark which i bought there with more people to the island and in it besides other supplies i sent seven women being such as i found proper for service or for wives to such as would take them as for the englishmen i promised them to send them some women from england with a good cargo of necessaries if they would apply themselves to planting which i afterwards could not perform the fellows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for them i sent them also from the brasils five cows three of them being big with calf some sheep and some hogs which when i came again were considerably increased but all these things with an account how three hundred caribbees came and invaded them and ruined their plantations and how they fought with that whole number twice and were at first defeated and some of them killed but at last a storm destroying their enemies canoes they famished or destroyed almost all the rest and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation and still lived upon the island all these things with some very surprising incidents in some new adventures of my own for ten years more i may perhaps give a further account of hereafter that homely proverb used on so many occasions in england viz that what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh was never more verified than in the story of my life any one would think that after thirty five years affliction and a variety of unhappy circumstances which few men if any ever went through before and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things grown old and when if ever it might be allowed me to have had experience of every state of middle life and to know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy i say after all this any one would have thought that the native propensity to rambling which i gave an account of in my first setting out into the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts should be worn out the volatile part be fully evacuated or at least condensed and i might at sixty one years of age have been a little inclined to stay at home and have done venturing life and fortune any more nay farther the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away in me for i had no fortune to make i had nothing to seek if i had gained ten thousand pounds i had been no richer for i had already sufficient for me and for those i had to leave it to and that i had was visibly increasing for having no great family i could not spend the income of what i had unless i would set up for an expensive way of living such as a great family servants equipage gaiety and the like which were things i had no notion of or inclination to so that i had nothing indeed to do but to sit still and fully enjoy what i had got and see it increase daily upon my hands yet all these things had no effect upon me or at least not enough to resist the strong inclination i had to go abroad again which hung about me like a chronical distemper particularly the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island and the colony i left there ran in my head continually i dreamed of it all night and my imagination ran upon it all day it was uppermost in all my thoughts and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it that i talked of it in my sleep in short nothing could remove it out of my mind it even broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome for i could talk of nothing else all my discourse ran into it even to impertinence and i saw it myself i have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing to the strength of imagination and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing or a ghost walking and the like that people s poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so realizes it to them that they are capable of fancying upon some extraordinary circumstances that they see them talk to them and are answered by them when in truth there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing and they really know nothing of the matter for my part i know not to this hour whether there are any such things as real apparitions spectres or walking of people after they are dead or whether there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that kind more than the product of vapours sick minds and wandering fancies but this i know that my imagination worked up to such a height and brought me into such excess of vapours or what else i may call it that i actually supposed myself oftentimes upon the spot at my old castle behind the trees saw my old spaniard friday s father and the reprobate sailors whom i left upon the island nay i fancied i talked with them and looked at them so steadily though i was broad awake as at persons just before me and this i did till i often frightened myself with the images my fancy represented to me one time in my sleep i had the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first spaniard and friday s father that it was surprising they told me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the spaniards and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up on purpose to distress and starve them things that i had never heard of and that were yet all of them true in fact but it was so warm in my imagination and so realized to me that to the hour i saw them i could not be persuaded but that it was or would be true also how i resented it when the spaniard complained to me and how i brought them to justice tried them before me and ordered them all three to be hanged what there was really in this shall be seen in its place for however i came to form such things in my dream and what secret converse of spirits injected it yet there was i say very much of it true i own that this dream had nothing literally and specifically true but the general part was so true the base and villanous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such and had been so much worse than all i can describe that the dream had too much similitude of the fact and as i would afterwards have punished them severely so if i had hanged them all i had been much in the right and should have been justifiable both by the laws of god and man but to return to my story in this kind of temper i had lived some years i had no enjoyment of my life no pleasant hours no agreeable diversion but what had something or other of this in it so that my wife who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it told me very seriously one night that she believed there was some secret powerful impulse of providence upon me which had determined me to go thither again and that she found nothing hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and children she told me that it was true she could not think of parting with me but as she was assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing i would do so as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above she would not be the only obstruction for if i thought fit and resolved to go here she found me very intent upon her words and that i looked very earnestly at her so that it a little disordered her and she stopped i asked her why she did not go on and say out what she was going to say but i perceived her heart was too full and some tears stood in her eyes speak out my dear said i are you willing i should go no says she very affectionately i am far from willing but if you are resolved to go says she and rather than i will be the only hindrance i will go with you for though i think it a preposterous thing for one of your years and in your condition yet if it must be said she again weeping i won t leave you for if it be of heaven you must do it there is no resisting it and if heaven makes it your duty to go he will also make it mine to go with you or otherwise dispose of me that i may not obstruct it this affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me a little out of the vapours and i began to consider what i was doing i corrected my wandering fancy and began to argue with myself sedately what business i had after threescore years and after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters and closed in so happy and easy a manner i say what business had i to rush into new hazards and put myself upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run into with those thoughts i considered my new engagement that i had a wife one child born and my wife then great with child of another that i had all the world could give me and had no need to seek hazards for gain that i was declining in years and ought to think rather of leaving what i had gained than of seeking to increase it that as to what my wife had said of its being an impulse from heaven and that it should be my duty to go i had no notion of that so after many of these cogitations i struggled with the power of my imagination reasoned myself out of it as i believe people may always do in like cases if they will and in a word i conquered it composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts and which my present condition furnished me plentifully with and particularly as the most effectual method i resolved to divert myself with other things and to engage in some business that might effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this kind for i found the thing return upon me chiefly when i was idle had nothing to do or any thing of moment immediately before me to this purpose i bought a little farm in the county of bedford and resolved to remove myself thither i had a little convenient house upon it and the land about it i found was capable of great improvement and that it was many ways suited to my inclination which delighted in cultivating managing planting and improving of land and particularly being an inland country i was removed from conversing among ships sailors and things relating to the remote part of the world in a word i went down to my farm settled my family bought me ploughs harrows a cart waggon horses cows sheep and setting seriously to work became in one half year a mere country gentleman my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants cultivating the ground enclosing planting c and i lived as i thought the most agreeable life that nature was capable of directing or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being retreated to i farmed upon my own land i had no rent to pay was limited by no articles i could pull up or cut down as i pleased what i planted was for myself and what i improved was for my family and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering i had not the least discomfort in any part of my life as to this world now i thought indeed that i enjoyed the middle state of life which my father so earnestly recommended to me a kind of heavenly life something like what is described by the poet upon the subject of a country life free from vices free from care age has no pains and youth no snare but in the middle of all this felicity one blow from unforeseen providence unhinged me at once and not only made a breach upon me inevitable and incurable but drove me by its consequence upon a deep relapse into the wandering disposition which as i may say being born in my very blood soon recovered its hold of me and like the returns of a violent distemper came on with an irresistible force upon me so that nothing could make any more impression upon me this blow was the loss of my wife it is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife to give a character of her particular virtues and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon she was in a few words the stay of all my affairs the centre of all my enterprises the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy compass i was in from the most extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in my head as above and did more to guide my rambling genius than a mother s tears a father s instructions a friend s counsel or all my own reasoning powers could do i was happy in listening to her tears and in being moved by her entreaties and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss of her when she was gone the world looked awkwardly round me i was as much a stranger in it in my thoughts as i was in the brasils when i went first on shore there and as much alone except as to the assistance of servants as i was in my island i knew neither what to do or what not to do i saw the world busy round me one part labouring for bread and the other part squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures equally miserable because the end they proposed still fled from them for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their vice and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance and the men of labour spent their strength in daily strugglings for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured with so living in a daily circulation of sorrow living but to work and working but to live as if daily bread were the only end of a wearisome life and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread this put me in mind of the life i lived in my kingdom the island where i suffered no more corn to grow because i did not want it and bred no more goats because i had no more use for them where the money lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed and had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty years all these things had i improved them as i ought to have done and as reason and religion had dictated to me would have taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity and that there was something which certainly was the reason and end of life superior to all these things and which was either to be possessed or at least hoped for on this side the grave but my sage counsellor was gone i was like a ship without a pilot that could only run before the wind my thoughts run all away again into the old affair my head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign adventures and all the pleasing innocent amusements of my farm and my garden my cattle and my family which before entirely possessed me were nothing to me had no relish and were like music to one that has no ear or food to one that has no taste in a word i resolved to leave off housekeeping let my farm and return to london and in a few months after i did so when i came to london i was still as uneasy as before i had no relish to the place no employment in it nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in god s creation and it is not one farthing matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive this also was the thing which of all circumstances of life was the most my aversion who had been all my days used to an active life and i would often say to myself a state of idleness is the very dregs of life and indeed i thought i was much more suitably employed when i was twenty six days making me a deal board it was now the beginning of the year 1693 when my nephew whom as i have observed before i had brought up to the sea and had made him commander of a ship was come home from a short voyage to bilboa being the first he had made he came to me and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the east indies and to china as private traders and now uncle says he if you will go to sea with me i ll engage to land you upon your old habitation in the island for we are to touch at the brasils nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state and of the existence of an invisible world than the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of things which we form in our minds perfectly reserved and not communicated to any in the world my nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was returned upon me and i knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say when that very morning before he came to me i had in a great deal of confusion of thought and revolving every part of my circumstances in my mind come to this resolution viz that i would go to lisbon and consult with my old sea captain and so if it was rational and practicable i would go and see the island again and see what was become of my people there i had pleased myself also with the thoughts of peopling the place and carrying inhabitants from hence getting a patent for the possession and i know not what when in the middle of all this in comes my nephew as i have said with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the east indies i paused awhile at his words and looking steadily at him what devil said i sent you of this unlucky errand my nephew startled as if he had been frighted at first but perceiving i was not much displeased with the proposal he recovered himself i hope it may not be an unlucky proposal sir says he i dare say you would be pleased to see your new colony there where you once reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the world in a word the scheme hit so exactly with my temper that is to say with the prepossession i was under and of which i have said so much that i told him in a few words if he agreed with the merchants i would go with him but i told him i would not promise to go any farther than my own island why sir says he you don t want to be left there again i hope why said i can you not take me up again in your return he told me it could not be possible that the merchants would allow him to come that way with a loaden ship of such value it being a month s sail out of his way and might be three or four besides sir if i should miscarry said he and not return at all then you would be just reduced to the condition you were in before this was very rational but we both found out a remedy for it which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship which being taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship might by the help of some carpenters whom we agreed to carry with us be set up again in the island and finished fit to go to sea in a few days i was not long resolving for indeed the importunities of my nephew joined in so effectually with my inclination that nothing could oppose me on the other hand my wife being dead i had nobody concerned themselves so much for me as to persuade me one way or other except my ancient good friend the widow who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years my easy circumstances and the needless hazard of a long voyage and above all my young children but it was all to no purpose i had an irresistible desire to the voyage and i told her i thought there was something so uncommon in the impressions i had upon my mind for the voyage that it would be a kind of resisting providence if i should attempt to stay at home after which she ceased her expostulations and joined with me not only in making provision for my voyage but also in settling my family affairs in my absence and providing for the education of my children in order to this i made my will and settled the estate i had in such a manner for my children and placed in such hands that i was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them whatever might befal me and for their education i left it wholly to my widow with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care all which she richly deserved for no mother could have taken more care in their education or understood it better and as she lived till i came home i also lived to thank her for it my nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of january 1694 5 and i with my man friday went on board in the downs the 8th having besides that sloop which i mentioned above a very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony which if i did not find in good condition i resolved to leave so first i carried with me some servants whom i purposed to place there as inhabitants or at least to set on work there upon my own account while i stayed and either to leave them there or carry them forward as they should appear willing particularly i carried two carpenters a smith and a very handy ingenious fellow who was a cooper by trade but was also a general mechanic for he was dexterous at making wheels and hand mills to grind corn was a good turner and a good potmaker he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth or of wood in a word we called him our jack of all trades with these i carried a tailor who had offered himself to go passenger to the east indies with my nephew but afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation and proved a most necessary handy fellow as could be desired in many other businesses besides that of this trade for as i observed formerly necessity arms us for all employments my cargo as near as i can recollect for i have not kept an account of the particulars consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen and some thin english stuffs for clothing the spaniards that i expected to find there and enough of them as by my calculation might comfortably supply them for seven years if i remember right the materials which i carried for clothing them with gloves hats shoes stockings and all such things as they could want for wearing amounted to above two hundred pounds including some beds bedding and household stuff particularly kitchen utensils with pots kettles pewter brass c besides near a hundred pounds more in iron work nails tools of every kind staples hooks hinges and every necessary thing i could think of i carried also a hundred spare arms muskets and fuzees besides some pistols a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes three or four tons of lead and two pieces of brass cannon and because i knew not what time and what extremities i was providing for i carried an hundred barrels of powder besides swords cutlasses and the iron part of some pikes and halberts so that in short we had a large magazine of all sorts of stores and i made my nephew carry two small quarter deck guns more than he wanted for his ship to leave behind if there was occasion that when they came there we might build a fort and man it against all sorts of enemies and indeed i at first thought there would be need enough of it all and much more if we hoped to maintain our possession of the island as shall be seen in the course of the story i had not such bad luck in this voyage as i had been used to meet with and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader who perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters went with my colony yet some odd accidents cross winds and bad weather happened on this first setting out which made the voyage longer than i expected it at first and i who had never made but one voyage viz my first voyage to guinea in which i might be said to come back again as the voyage was at first designed began to think the same ill fate still attended me and that i was born to be never contented with being on shore and yet to be always unfortunate at sea contrary winds first put us to the northward and we were obliged to put in at galway in ireland where we lay wind bound two and thirty days but we had this satisfaction with the disaster that provisions were here exceeding cheap and in the utmost plenty so that while we lay here we never touched the ship s stores but rather added to them here also i took several hogs and two cows with their calves which i resolved if i had a good passage to put on shore in my island but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them we set out the 5th of february from ireland and had a very fair gale of wind for some days as i remember it might be about the 20th of february in the evening late when the mate having the watch came into the round house and told us he saw a flash of fire and heard a gun fired and while he was telling us of it a boy came in and told us the boatswain heard another this made us all run out upon the quarter deck where for a while we heard nothing but in a few minutes we saw a very great light and found that there was some very terrible fire at a distance immediately we had recourse to our reckonings in which we all agreed that there could be no land that way in which the fire shewed itself no not for five hundred leagues for it appeared at w n w upon this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before we concluded it could not be far off we stood directly towards it and were presently satisfied we should discover it because the farther we sailed the greater the light appeared though the weather being hazy we could not perceive any thing but the light for a while in about half an hour s sailing the wind being fair for us though not much of it and the weather clearing up a little we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of the sea i was most sensibly touched with this disaster though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it i presently recollected my former circumstances in what condition i was in when taken up by the portugal captain and how much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this ship must be if they had no other ship in company with them upon this i immediately ordered that five guns should be fired one soon after another that if possible we might give notice to them that there was help for them at hand and that they might endeavour to save themselves in their boat for though we could see the flame in the ship yet they it being night could see nothing of us we lay by some time upon this only driving as the burning ship drove waiting for daylight when on a sudden to our great terror though we had reason to expect it the ship blew up in the air and immediately sunk this was terrible and indeed an afflicting sight for the sake of the poor men who i concluded must be either all destroyed in the ship or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the middle of the ocean which at present by reason it was dark i could not see however to direct them as well as i could i caused lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could and which we had lanterns for and kept firing guns all the night long letting them know by this that there was a ship not far off about eight o clock in the morning we discovered the ship s boats by the help of our perspective glasses and found there were two of them both thronged with people and deep in the water we perceived they rowed the wind being against them that they saw our ship and did the utmost to make us see them we immediately spread our ancient to let them know we saw them and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on board and then made more sail standing directly to them in a little more than half an hour we came up with them and in a word took them all in being no less than sixty four men women and children for there were a great many passengers upon the whole we found it was a french merchant ship of three hundred tons homeward bound from quebec in the river of canada the master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the steersman but on his crying out for help was as everybody thought entirely put out but they soon found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could not effectually quench it and afterwards getting in between the timbers and within the ceiling of the ship it proceeded into the hold and mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to exert they had no more to do then but to get into their boats which to their great comfort were pretty large being their long boat and a great shallop besides a small skiff which was of no great service to them other than to get some fresh water and provisions into her after they had secured themselves from the fire they had indeed small hope of their lives by getting into these boats at that distance from any land only as they said well that they were escaped from the fire and had a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea and might take them in they had sails oars and a compass and were preparing to make the best of their way to newfoundland the wind blowing pretty fair for it blew an easy gale at s e by e they had as much provisions and water as with sparing it so as to be next door to starving might support them about twelve days in which if they had no bad weather and no contrary winds the captain said he hoped he might get to the banks of newfoundland and might perhaps take some fish to sustain them till they might go on shore but there were so many chances against them in all these cases such as storms to overset and founder them rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs contrary winds to keep them out and starve them that it must have been next to miraculous if they had escaped in the midst of their consultations every one being hopeless and ready to despair the captain with tears in his eyes told me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire and after that four more these were the five guns which i caused to be fired at first seeing the light this revived their hearts and gave them the notice which as above i designed it should viz that there was a ship at hand for their help it was upon the hearing these guns that they took down their masts and sails and the sound coming from the windward they resolved to lie by till morning some time after this hearing no more guns they fired three muskets one a considerable while after another but these the wind being contrary we never heard some time after that again they were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights and hearing the guns which as i have said i caused to be fired all the rest of the night this set them to work with their oars to keep their boats ahead at least that we might the sooner come up with them and at last to their inexpressible joy they found we saw them it is impossible for me to express the several gestures the strange ecstasies the variety of postures which these poor delivered people ran into to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance grief and fear are easily described sighs tears groans and a very few motions of head and hands make up the sum of its variety but an excess of joy a surprise of joy has a thousand extravagances in it there were some in tears some raging and tearing themselves as if they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow some stark raving and downright lunatic some ran about the ship stamping with their feet others wringing their hands some were dancing several singing some laughing more crying many quite dumb not able to speak a word others sick and vomiting several swooning and ready to faint and a few were crossing themselves and giving god thanks i would not wrong them neither there might he many that were thankful afterward but the passion was too strong for them at first and they were not able to master it they were thrown into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy and so there were but a very few who were composed and serious in their joy perhaps also the case may have some addition to it from the particular circumstance of the nation they belonged to i mean the french whose temper is allowed to be more volatile more passionate and more sprightly and their spirits more fluid than of other nations i am not philosopher to determine the cause but nothing i had ever seen before came up to it the ecstasies poor friday my trusty savage was in when he found his father in the boat came the nearest to it and the surprise of the master and his two companions whom i delivered from the two villains that set them on shore in the island came a little way towards it but nothing was to compare to this either that i saw in friday or any where else in my life it is farther observable that these extravagances did not shew themselves in that different manner i have mentioned in different persons only but all the variety would appear in a short succession of moments in one and the same person a man that we saw this minute dumb and as it were stupid and confounded should the next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic and the next moment a tearing his hair or pulling his clothes to pieces and stamping them under his feet like a madman a few minutes after that we should have him all in tears then sick then swooning and had not immediate help been had would in a few moments more have been dead and thus it was not with one or two or ten or twenty but with the greatest part of them and if i remember right our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty of them blood there were two priests among them one an old man and the other a young man and that which was strangest was that the oldest man was the worst as soon as he set his foot on board our ship and saw himself safe he dropped down stone dead to all appearance not the least sign of life could be perceived in him our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to recover him and was the only man in the ship that believed he was not dead and at length he opened a vein in his arm having first chafed and rubbed the part so as to warm it as much as possible upon this the blood which only dropped at first flowed something freely in three minutes after the man opened his eyes and about a quarter of an hour after that he spoke grew better and in a little time quite well after the blood was stopped he walked about told us he was perfectly well took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him and was what we called come to himself about a quarter of an hour after this they came running into the cabin to the surgeon who was bleeding a french woman that had fainted and told him the priest was gone stark mad it seems he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind and this put him into an ecstasy of joy his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them the blood grew hot and feverish and the man was as fit for bedlam as any creature that ever was in it the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition but gave him something to doze and put him to sleep which after some time operated upon him and he waked next morning perfectly composed and well the younger priest behaved himself with great command of his passion and was really an example of a serious well governed mind at his first coming on board the ship he threw himself flat on his face prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance in which i unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him really thinking he had been in a swoon but he spoke calmly thanked me told me he was giving god thanks for his deliverance begged me to leave him a few moments and that next to his maker he would give me thanks also i was heartily sorry that i disturbed him and not only left him but kept others from interrupting him also he continued in that posture about three minutes or a little more after i left him then came to me as he had said he would and with a great deal of seriousness and affection but with tears in his eyes thanked me that had under god given him and so many miserable creatures their lives i told him i had no room to move him to thank god for it rather than me for i had seen that he had done that already but i added that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to god who had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures after this the young priest applied himself to his country folks laboured to compose them persuaded entreated argued reasoned with them and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason and with some he had success though others were for a time out of all government of themselves i cannot help committing this to writing as perhaps it may be useful to those into whose hands it may fall in the guiding themselves in all the extravagances of their passions for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason what will not the extravagances of anger rage and a provoked mind carry us to and indeed here i saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind as well those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger we were something disordered by these extravagances among our new guests for the first day but when they had been retired lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would allow and they had slept heartily as most of them did being fatigued and frightened they were quite another sort of people the next day nothing of good manners or civil acknowledgments for the kindness shown them was wanting the french it is known are naturally apt enough to exceed that way the captain and one of the priests came to me the next day and desiring to speak with me and my nephew the commander began to consult with us what should be done with them and first they told us that as we had saved their lives so all they had was little enough for a return to us for the kindness received the captain said they had saved some money and some things of value in their boats catched hastily out of the flames and if we would accept it they were ordered to make an offer of it all to us they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way where if possible they might get a passage to france my nephew was for accepting their money at first word and to consider what to do with them afterwards but i overruled him in that part for i knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange country and if the portugal captain that took me up at sea had served me so and took all i had for my deliverance i must have starved or have been as much a slave at the brasils as i had been at barbary the being sold to a mahometan only excepted and perhaps a portuguese is not a much better master than a turk if not in some cases a much worse i therefore told the french captain that we had taken them up in their distress it was true but that it was our duty to do so as we were fellow creatures and as we would desire to be so delivered if we were in the like or any other extremity that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us if we had been in their case and they in ours but that we took them up to serve them not to plunder them and that it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from them which they had saved out of the fire and then set them on shore and leave them that this would be first to save them from death and then kill them ourselves save them from drowning and then abandon them to starving and therefore i would not let the least thing be taken from them as to setting them on shore i told them indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us for that the ship was bound to the east indies and though we were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way which perhaps was directed by heaven on purpose for their deliverance yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on this particular account nor could my nephew the captain answer it to the freighters with whom he was under charter party to pursue his voyage by the way of brasil and all i knew he could do for them was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward bound from the west indies and get them passage if possible to england or france the first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they could not but be very thankful for it but they were in a great consternation especially the passengers at the notion of being carried away to the east indies they then entreated me that seeing i was driven so far to the westward before i met with them i would at least keep on the same course to the banks of newfoundland where it was possible i might meet some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to canada from whence they came i thought this was but a reasonable request on their part and therefore i inclined to agree to it for indeed i considered that to carry this whole company to the east indies would not only be an intolerable severity to the poor people but would be ruining our voyage by devouring all our provisions so i thought it no breach of charter party but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us and in which no one could say we were to blame for the laws of god and nature would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a distressed condition and the nature of the thing as well respecting ourselves as the poor people obliged us to see them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance so i consented that we would carry them to newfoundland if wind and weather would permit and if not that i would carry them to martinico in the west indies the wind continued fresh easterly but the weather pretty good and as it had blowed continually in the points between n e and s e a long time we missed several opportunities of sending them to france for we met several ships bound to europe whereof two were french from st christopher s but they had been so long beating up against the wind that they durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage as well for themselves as for those they should take in so we were obliged to go on it was about a week after this that we made the banks of newfoundland where to shorten my story we put all our french people on board a bark which they hired at sea there to put them on shore and afterwards to carry them to france if they could get provisions to victual themselves with when i say all the french went on shore i should remember that the young priest i spoke of hearing we were bound to the east indies desired to go the voyage with us and to be set on shore on the coast of coromandel i readily agreed to that for i wonderfully liked the man and had very good reason as will appear afterwards also four of the seamen entered themselves in our ship and proved very useful fellows from hence we directed our course for the west indies steering away s and s by e for about twenty days together sometimes little or no wind at all when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon almost as deplorable as that before it was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes n and the 19th day of march 1684 5 when we espied a sail our course s e and by s we soon perceived it was a large vessel and that she bore up to us but could not at first know what to make of her till after coming a little nearer we found she had lost her main topmast fore mast and bowsprit and presently she fires a gun as a signal of distress the weather was pretty good wind at n n w a fresh gale and we soon came to speak with her we found her a ship of bristol bound home from barbadoes but had been blown out of the road at barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail by a terrible hurricane while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore so that beside the terror of the storm they were but in an indifferent case for good artists to bring the ship home they had been already nine weeks at sea and had met with another terrible storm after the hurricane was over which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the westward and in which they had lost their masts as above they told us they expected to have seen the bahama islands but were then driven away again to the south east by a strong gale of wind at n n w the same that blew now and having no sails to work the ship with but a main course and a kind of square sail upon a jury foremast which they had set up they could not lie near the wind but were endeavouring to stand away for the canaries but that which was worst of all was that they were almost starved for want of provisions besides the fatigues they had undergone their bread and flesh was quite gone they had not an ounce left in the ship and had had none for eleven days the only relief they had was their water was not all spent and they had about half a barrel of flour left they had sugar enough some succades or sweetmeats they had at first but they were devoured and they had seven casks of rum there was a youth and his mother and a maid servant on board who were going passengers and thinking the ship was ready to sail unhappily came on board the evening before the hurricane began and having no provisions of their own left they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest for the seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves had no compassion we may be sure for the poor passengers and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very hard to describe i had perhaps not known this part if my curiosity had not led me the weather being fair and the wind abated to go on board the ship the second mate who upon this occasion commanded the ship had been on board our ship and he told me indeed that they had three passengers in the great cabin that they were in a deplorable condition nay says he i believe they are dead for i have heard nothing of them for above two days and i was afraid to inquire after them said he for i had nothing to relieve them with we immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could spare and indeed i had so far overruled things with my nephew that i would have victualled them though we had gone away to virginia or any part of the coast of america to have supplied ourselves but there was no necessity for that but now they were in a new danger for they were afraid of eating too much even of that little we gave them the mate or commander brought six men with him in his boat but these poor wretches looked like skeletons and were so weak they could hardly sit to their oars the mate himself was very ill and half starved for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men and went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate i cautioned him to eat sparingly but set meat before him immediately and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of order so he stopped awhile and our surgeon mixed him up something with some broth which he said would be to him both food and physic and after he had taken it he grew better in the meantime i forgot not the men i ordered victuals to be given them and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it they were so exceeding hungry that they were in a manner ravenous and had no command of themselves and two of them ate with so much greediness that they were in danger of their lives the next morning the sight of these people s distress was very moving to me and brought to mind what i had a terrible respect of at my first coming on shore in my island where i had not the least mouthful of food or any hopes of procuring it besides the hourly apprehension i had of being made the food of other creatures but all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship s company i could not put out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin viz the mother her son and the maid servant whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days and whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected their own extremities being so great by which i understood that they had really given them no food at all and that therefore they must be perished and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin as i therefore kept the mate whom we then called captain on board with his men to refresh them so i also forgot not the starving crew that were left on board but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship and with my mate and twelve men to carry them a sack of bread and four or five pieces of beef to boil our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed and to keep guard in the cook room to prevent the men s taking it to eat raw or taking it out of the pot before it was well boiled and then to give every man but a little at a time and by this caution he preserved the men who would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that was given them on purpose to save their lives at the same time i ordered the mate to go into the great cabin and see what condition the poor passengers were in and if they were alive to comfort them and give them what refreshment was proper and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate that was on board and which he did not question would restore them gradually i was not satisfied with this but as i said above having a great mind to see the scene of misery which i knew the ship itself would present me with in a more lively manner than i could have it by report i took the captain of the ship as we now called him with me and went myself a little after in their boat i found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready but my mate observed his order and kept a good guard at the cook room door and the man he placed there after using all possible persuasion to have patience kept them off by force however he caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot and softened them with the liquor of the meat which they call brewis and gave every one one to stay their stomachs and told them it was for their own safety that he was obliged to give them but little at a time but it was all in vain and had i not come on board and their own commander and officers with me and with good words and some threats also of giving them no more i believe they would have broke into the cook room by force and torn the meat out of the furnace for words indeed are of a very small force to an hungry belly however we pacified them and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first time and the next time gave them more and at last filled their bellies and the men did well enough but the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature and far beyond the rest for as first the ship s company had so little for themselves it was but too true that they had at first kept them very low and at last totally neglected them so that for six or seven days it might be said they had really had no food at all and for several days before very little the poor mother who as the first mate reported was a woman of good sense and good breeding had spared all she could get so affectionately for her son that at last she entirely sunk under it and when the mate of our ship went in she sat upon the floor or deck with her back up against the sides between two chairs which were lashed fast and her head sunk in between her shoulders like a corpse though not quite dead my mate said all he could to revive and encourage her and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth she opened her lips and lifted up one hand but could not speak yet she understood what he said and made signs to him intimating that it was too late for her but pointed to her child as if she would have said they should take care of him however the mate who was exceedingly moved with the sight endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth and as he said got two or three spoonfuls down though i question whether he could be sure of it or not but it was too late and she died the same night the youth who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate mother s life was not so far gone yet he lay in a cabin bed as one stretched out with hardly any life left in him he had a piece of an old glove in his mouth having eaten up the rest of it however being young and having more strength than his mother the mate got something down his throat and he began sensibly to revive though by giving him some time after but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary he was very sick and brought it up again but the next care was the poor maid she lay all along upon the deck hard by her mistress and just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy and struggled for life her limbs were distorted one of her hands was clasped round the frame of one chair and she griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let it go her other arm lay over her head and her feet lay both together set fast against the frame of the cabin table in short she lay just like one in the last agonies of death and yet she was alive too the poor creature was not only starved with hunger and terrified with the thoughts of death but as the men told us afterwards was broken hearted for her mistress whom she saw dying two or three days before and whom she loved most tenderly we knew not what to do with this poor girl for when our surgeon who was a man of very great knowledge and experience and with great application recovered her as to life he had her upon his hand as to her senses for she was little less than distracted for a considerable time after as shall appear presently whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to consider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place our business was to relieve this distressed ship s crew but not lie by for them and though they were willing to steer the same course with us for some days yet we could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts however as their captain begged of us to help him to set up a main topmast and a kind of topmast to his jury foremast we did as it were lie by him for three or four days and then having given him five barrels of beef and pork two hogsheads of biscuit and a proportion of peas flour and what other things we could spare and taking three casks of sugar and some rum and some pieces of eight of them for satisfaction we left them taking on board with us at their own earnest request the youth and the maid and all their goods the young lad was about seventeen years of age a pretty well bred modest and sensible youth greatly dejected with the loss of his mother and as it happened had lost his father bit a few months before at barbados he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his mother and indeed so they had that is to say passively for they might have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless widow that might have preserved her life though it had been just to keep her alive but hunger knows no friend no relation no justice no right and therefore is remorseless and capable of no compassion the surgeon told him how far we were going and how it would carry him away from all his friends and put him perhaps in as bad circumstance almost as we found them in that is to say starving in the world he said it mattered not whither he went if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was among that the captain by which he meant me for he could know nothing of my nephew had saved his life and he was sure would not hurt him and as for the maid he was sure if she came to herself she would he very thankful for it let us carry them whither we would the surgeon represented the case so affectionately to me that i yielded and we took them both on board with all their goods except eleven hogsheads of sugar which could not be removed or come at and as the youth had a bill of lading for them i made his commander sign a writing obliging him to go as soon as he came to bristol to one mr rogers a merchant there to whom the youth said he was related and to deliver a letter which i wrote to him and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow which i suppose was not done for i could never learn that the ship came to bristol but was as is most probable lost at sea being in so disabled a condition and so far from any land that i am of opinion the first storm she met with afterwards she might founder in the sea for she was leaky and had damage in her hold when i met with her i was now in the latitude of 19 deg 32 min and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather though at first the winds had been contrary i shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind weather currents c on the rest of our voyage but shortening my story for the sake of what is to follow shall observe that i came to my old habitation the island on the 10th of april 1695 it was with no small difficulty that i found the place for as i came to it and went from it before on the south and east side of the island as coming from the brasils so now coming in between the main and the island and having no chart for the coast nor any land mark i did not know it when i saw it or know whether i saw it or no we beat about a great while and went on shore on several islands in the mouth of the great river oroonoque but none for my purpose only this i learnt by my coasting the shore that i was under one great mistake before viz that the continent which i thought i saw from the island i lived in was really no continent but a long island or rather a ridge of islands reaching from one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great river and that the savages who came to my island were not properly those which we call caribbees but islanders and other barbarians of the same kind who inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest in short i visited several of the islands to no purpose some i found were inhabited and some were not on one of them i found some spaniards and thought they had lived there but speaking with them found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by and that they came thither to make salt and catch some pearl muscles if they could but they belonged to the isle de trinidad which lay farther north in the latitude of 10 and 11 degrees thus coasting from one island to another sometimes with the ship sometimes with the frenchman s shallop which we had found a convenient boat and therefore kept her with their very good will at length i came fair on the south side of my island and i presently knew the very countenance of the place so i brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside with the little creek where was my old habitation as soon as i saw the place i called for friday and asked him if he knew where he was he looked about a little and presently clapping his hands cried o yes o there o yes o there pointing to our old habitation and fell a dancing and capering like a mad fellow and i had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea to swim ashore to the place well friday said i do you think we shall find any body here or no and what do you think shall we see your father the fellow stood mute as a stock a good while but when i named his father the poor affectionate creature looked dejected and i could see the tears run down his face very plentifully what is the matter friday said i are you troubled because you may see your father no no says he shaking his head no see him more no ever more see again why so said i friday how do you know that o no o no says friday he long ago die long ago he much old man well well said i friday you don t know but shall we see any one else then the fellow it seems had better eyes than i and he points just to the hill above my old house and though we lay half a league off he cries out me see me see yes yes me see much man there and there and there i looked but i could see nobody no not with a perspective glass which was i suppose because i could not hit the place for the fellow was right as i found upon inquiry the next day and there were five or six men all together stood to look at the ship not knowing what to think of us as soon as friday had told me he saw people i caused the english ancient to be spread and fired three guns to give them notice we were friends and about half a quarter of an hour after we perceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek so i immediately ordered a boat out taking friday with me and hanging out a white flag or a flag of truce i went directly on shore taking with me the young friar i mentioned to whom i had told the whole story of living there and the manner of it and every particular both of myself and those that i left there and who was on that account extremely desirous to go with me we had besides about sixteen men very well armed if we had found any new guest there which we did not know of but we had no need of weapons as we went on shore upon the tide of flood near high water we rowed directly into the creek and the first man i fixed my eye upon was the spaniard whose life i had saved and whom i knew by his face perfectly well as to his habit i shall describe it afterwards i ordered nobody to go on shore at first but myself but there was no keeping friday in the boat for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance a good way off of the spaniards where indeed i saw nothing of him and if they had not let him go on shore he would have jumped into the sea he was no sooner on shore but he flew away to his father like an arrow out of a bow it would have made any man shed tears in spite of the firmest resolution to have seen the first transports of this poor fellow s joy when he came to his father how he embraced him kissed him stroked his face took him in his arms set him down upon a tree and lay down by him then stood and looked at him as any one would look at a strange picture for a quarter of an hour together then lay down upon the ground and stroked his legs and kissed them and then got up again and stared at him one would have thought the fellow bewitched but it would have made a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion run out another way in the morning he walked along the shore to and again with his father several hours always leading him by the hand as if he had been a lady and every now and then would come to fetch something or other for him from the boat either a lump of sugar or a dram a biscuit or something or other that was good in the afternoon his frolics ran another way for then he would set the old man down upon the ground and dance about him and made a thousand antic postures and gestures and all the while he did this be would be talking to him and telling him one story or another of his travels and of what had happened to him abroad to divert him in short if the same filial affection was to be found in christians to their parents in our parts of the world one would be tempted to say there hardly would have been any need of the fifth commandment but this is a digression i return to my landing it would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the spaniards received me with the first spaniard whom as i said i knew very well was he whose life i saved he came towards the boat attended by one more carrying a flag of truce also and he did not only not know me at first but he had no thoughts no notion of its being me that was come til i spoke to him seignior said i in portuguese do you not know me at which he spoke not a word but giving his musket to the man that was with him threw his arms abroad and saying something in spanish that i did not perfectly hear came forward and embraced me telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he had once seen as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life he said abundance of very handsome things as a well bred spaniard always knows how and then beckoning to the person that attended him bade him go and call out his comrades he then asked me if i would walk to my old habitation where he would give me possession of my own house again and where i should see there had been but mean improvements so i walked along with him but alas i could no more find the place again than if i had never been there for they had planted so many trees and placed them in such a posture so thick and close to one another in ten years time they were grown so big that in short the place was inaccessible except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves only who made them could find i asked them what put them upon all these fortifications he told me i would say there was need enough of it when they had given an account how they had passed their time since their arriving in the island especially after they had the misfortune to find that i was gone he told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune when he heard that i was gone in a good ship and to my satisfaction and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time or other he should see me again but nothing that ever befel him in his life he said was so surprising and afflicting to him at first as the disappointment he was under when he came back to the island and found i was not there as to the three barbarians so he called them that were left behind and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me the spaniards all thought themselves much better among the savages only that their number was so small and says he had they been strong enough we had been all long ago in purgatory and with that he crossed himself upon the breast but sir says he i hope you will not be displeased when i shall tell you how forced by necessity we were obliged for our own preservation to disarm them and making them our subjects who would not be content with being moderately our masters but would be our murderers i answered i was heartily afraid of it when i left them there and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that they were not come back that i might have put them in possession of every thing first and left the other in a state of subjection as they deserved but if they had reduced them to it i was very glad and should be very far from finding any fault with it for i knew they were a parcel of refractory ungovernable villains and were fit for any manner of mischief while i was saying this came the man whom he had sent back and with him eleven men more in the dress they were in it was impossible to guess what nation they were of but he made all clear both to them and to me first he turned to me and pointing to them said these sir are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you and then turning to them and pointing to me he let them know who i was upon which they all came up one by one not as if they had been sailors and ordinary fellows and i the like but really as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen and i a monarch or a great conqueror their behaviour was to the last degree obliging and courteous and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity which very well became them and in short they had so much more manners than i that i scarce knew how to receive their civilities much less how to return them in kind the history of their coming to and conduct in the island after my going away is so remarkable and has so many incidents which the former part of my relation will help to understand and which will in most of the particulars refer to that account i have already given that i cannot but commit them with great delight to the reading of those that come after me i shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said i s and said he s and he told me s and i told him s and the like but i shall collect the facts historically as near as i can gather them out of my memory from what they related to me and from what i met with in my conversing with them and with the place in order to do this succinctly and as intelligibly as i can i must go back to the circumstance in which i left the island and which the persons were in of whom i am to speak at first it is necessary to repeat that i had sent away friday s father and the spaniard the two whose lives i had rescued from the savages i say i had sent them away in a large canoe to the main as i then thought it to fetch over the spaniard s companions whom he had left behind him in order to save them from the like calamity that he had been in and in order to succour them for the present and that if possible we might together find some way for our deliverance afterward when i sent them away i had no visible appearance of or the least room to hope for my own deliverance any more than i had twenty years before much less had i any foreknowledge of what after happened i mean of an english ship coming on shore there to fetch them off and it could not but be a very great surprise to them when they came back not only to find that i was gone but to find three strangers left on the spot possessed of all that i had left behind me which would otherwise have been their own the first thing however which i inquired into that i might begin where i left off was of their own part and i desired he would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat when i sent him to fetch them over he told me there was little variety in that part for nothing remarkable happened to them on the way they having very calm weather and a smooth sea for his countrymen it could not be doubted he said but that they were overjoyed to see him it seems he was the principal man among them the captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time they were he said the more surprised to see him because they knew that he was fallen into the hands of savages who they were satisfied would devour him as they did all the rest of their prisoners that when he told them the story of the deliverance and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them away it was like a dream to them and their astonishment they said was something like that of joseph s brethren when he told them who he was and told them the story of his exaltation in pharaoh s court but when he shewed them the arms the powder the ball and the provisions that he brought them for their journey or voyage they were restored to themselves took a just share of the joy of their deliverance and immediately prepared to come away with him their first business was to get canoes and in this they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it but to trespass upon their friendly savages and to borrow two large canoes or periaguas on pretence of going out a fishing or for pleasure in these they came away the next morning it seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready for they had no baggage neither clothes or provisions or any thing in the world but what they had on them and a few roots to eat of which they used to make their bread they were in all three weeks absent and in that time unluckily for them i had the occasion offered for my escape as i mentioned in my other part and to get off from the island leaving three of the most impudent hardened ungoverned disagreeable villains behind me that any man could desire to meet with to the poor spaniards great grief and disappointment you may be sure the only just thing the rogues did was that when the spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to them and gave them provisions and other relief as i had ordered them to do also they gave them the long paper of directions which i had left with them containing the particular methods which i took for managing every part of my life there the way how i baked my bread bred up my tame goats and planted my corn how i cured my grapes made my pots and in a word every thing i did all this being written down they gave to the spaniards two of whom understood english well enough nor did they refuse to accommodate the spaniards with any thing else for they agreed very well for some time they gave them an equal admission into the house or cave and they began to live very sociably and the head spaniard who had seen pretty much of my method and friday s father together managed all their affairs for as for the englishmen they did nothing but ramble about the island shoot parrots and catch tortoises and when they came home at night the spaniards provided their suppers for them the spaniards would have been satisfied with this would the other but have left them alone which however they could not find in their hearts to do long but like the dog in the manger they would not eat themselves and would not let others eat neither the differences nevertheless were at first but trivial and such as are not worth relating but at last it broke out into open war and it began with all the rudeness and insolence that can be imagined without reason without provocation contrary to nature and indeed to common sense and though it is true the first relation of it came from the spaniards themselves whom i may call the accusers yet when i came to examine the fellows they could not deny a word of it but before i come to the particulars of this part i must supply a defect in my former relation and this was that i forgot to set down among the rest that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail there happened a little quarrel on board our ship which i was afraid once would turn to a second mutiny nor was it appeased till the captain rousing up his courage and taking us all to his assistance parted them by force and making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners he laid them in irons and as they had been active in the former disorders and let fall some ugly dangerous words the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to england and have them hanged there for mutiny and running away with the ship this it seems though the captain did not intend to do it frighted some other men in the ship and some of them had put it in the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them good words for the present till they should come to some english port and that then they should be all put into a gaol and tried for their lives the mate got intelligence of this and acquainted us with it upon which it was desired that i who still passed for a great man among them should go down with the mate and satisfy the men and tell them that they might be assured if they behaved well the rest of the voyage all they had done for the time past should be pardoned so i went and after passing my honour s word to them they appeared easy and the more so when i caused the two men who were in irons to be released and forgiven but this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night the wind also falling calm next morning we found that our two men who had been laid in irons had stole each of them a musket and some other weapons what powder or shot they had we knew not and had taken the ship s pinnace which was not yet haled up and run away with her to their companions in roguery on shore as soon as we found this i ordered the long boat on shore with twelve men and the mate and away they went to seek the rogues but they could neither find them nor any of the rest for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore the mate was once resolved in justice to their roguery to have destroyed their plantations burnt all their household stuff and furniture and left them to shift without it but having no order he let all alone left every thing as they found it and bringing the pinnace away came on board without them these two men made their number five but the other three villains were so much wickeder than these that after they had been two or three days together they turned their two new comers out of doors to shift for themselves and would have nothing to do with them nor could they for a good while be persuaded to give them any food as for the spaniards they were not yet come when the spaniards came first on shore the business began to go forward the spaniards would have persuaded the three english brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again that as they said they might be all one family but they would not hear of it so the two poor fellows lived by themselves and finding nothing but industry and application would make them live comfortable they pitched their tents on the north shore of the island but a little more to the west to be out of the danger of the savages who always landed on the east parts of the island here they built two huts one to lodge in and the other to lay up their magazines and stores in and the spaniards having given them some corn for seed and especially some of the peas which i had left them they dug and planted and enclosed after the pattern i had set for them all and began to live pretty well their first crop of corn was on the ground and though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at first having had but a little time yet it was enough to relieve them and find them with bread or other eatables and one of the fellows being the cook s mate of the ship was very ready at making soup puddings and such other preparations as the rice and the milk and such little flesh as they got furnished him to do they were going on in a little thriving posture when the three unnatural rogues their own countrymen too in mere humour and to insult them came and bullied them and told them the island was theirs that the governor meaning me had given them possession of it and nobody else had any right to it and damn them they should build no houses upon their ground unless they would pay them rent for them the two men thought they had jested at first and asked them to come and sit down and see what fine houses they were that they had built and tell them what rent they demanded and one of them merrily told them if they were ground landlords he hoped if they built tenements upon the land and made improvements they would according to the custom of all landlords grant them a long lease and bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings one of the three damning and raging told them they should see they were not in jest and going to a little place at a distance where the honest men had made a fire to dress their victuals he takes a firebrand and claps it to the outside of their hut and very fairly set it on fire and it would have been all burnt down in a few minutes if one of the two had not run to the fellow thrust him away and trod the fire out with his feet and that not without some difficulty too the fellow was in such a rage at the honest man s thrusting him away that he turned upon him with a pole he had in his hand and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly and run into the hut he had ended his days at once his comrade seeing the danger they were both in ran in after him and immediately they came both out with their muskets and the man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down who began the quarrel with the stock of his musket and that before the other two could come to help him and then seeing the rest come at them they stood together and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them bade them stand off the others had fire arms with them too but one of the two honest men bolder than his comrade and made desperate by his danger told them if they offered to move hand or foot they were all dead men and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms they did not indeed lay down their arms but seeing him resolute it brought them to a parley and they consented to take their wounded man with them and be gone and indeed it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow however they were much in the wrong since they had the advantage that they did not disarm them effectually as they might have done and have gone immediately to the spaniards and given them an account how the rogues treated them for the three villains studied nothing but revenge and every day gave them some intimation that they did so but not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of their rogueries such as treading down their corn shooting three young kids and a she goat which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store and in a word plaguing them night and day in this manner it forced the two men to such a desperation that they resolved to fight them all three the first time they had a fair opportunity in order to this they resolved to go to the castle as they called it that was my old dwelling where the three rogues and the spaniards all lived together at that time intending to have a fair battle and the spaniards should stand by to see fair play so they got up in the morning before day and came to the place and called the englishmen by their names telling a spaniard that answered that they wanted to speak with them it happened that the day before two of the spaniards having been in the woods had seen one of the two englishmen whom for distinction i call the honest men and he had made a sad complaint to the spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with from their three countrymen and how they had ruined their plantation and destroyed their corn that they had laboured so hard to bring forward and killed the milch goat and their three kids which was all they had provided for their sustenance and that if he and his friends meaning the spaniards did not assist them again they should be starved when the spaniards came home at night and they were all at supper he took the freedom to reprove the three englishmen though in gentle and mannerly terms and asked them how they could be so cruel they being harmless inoffensive fellows and that they were putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they had one of the englishmen returned very briskly what had they to do there that they came on shore without leave and that they should not plant or build upon the island it was none of their ground why says the spaniard very calmly seignior inglese they must not starve the englishman replied like a true rough hewn tarpaulin they might starve and be d ed they should not plant nor build in that place but what must they do then seignior says the spaniard another of the brutes returned do d n them they should be servants and work for them but how can you expect that of them they are not bought with your money you have no right to make them servants the englishman answered the island was theirs the governor had given it to them and no man had any thing to do there but themselves and with that swore by his maker that he would go and burn all their new huts they should build none upon their land why seignior says the spaniard by the same rule we must be your servants too ay says the bold dog and so you shall too before we have done with you mixing two or three g d d mme s in the proper intervals of his speech the spaniard only smiled at that and made him no answer however this little discourse had heated them and starting up one says to the other i think it was he they called will atkins come jack let us go and have the other brush with them we will demolish their castle i will warrant you they shall plant no colony in our dominions upon this they were all trooping away with every man a gun a pistol and a sword and muttered some insolent things among themselves of what they would do to the spaniards too when opportunity offered but the spaniards it seems did not so perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars only that in general they threatened them hard for taking the two englishmen s part whither they went or how they bestowed their time that evening the spaniards said they did not know but it seems they wandered about the country part of the night and then lying down in the place which i used to call my bower they were weary and overslept themselves the case was this they had resolved to stay till midnight and so to take the poor men when they were asleep and they acknowledged it afterwards intending to set fire to their huts while they were in them and either burn them in them or murder them as they came out and as malice seldom sleeps very sound it was very strange they should not have been kept waking however as the two men had also a design upon them as i have said though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering it happened and very luckily for them all that they were up and gone abroad before the bloody minded rogues came to their huts when they came thither and found the men gone atkins who it seems was the forwardest man called out to his comrades ha jack here s the nest but d n them the birds are flown they mused awhile to think what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad so soon and suggested presently that the spaniards had given them notice of it and with that they shook hands and swore to one another that they would be revenged of the spaniards as soon as they had made this bloody bargain they fell to work with the poor men s habitation they did not set fire indeed to any thing but they pulled down both their houses and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not the least stick standing or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood they tore all their little collected household stuff in pieces and threw every thing about in such a manner that the poor men found afterwards some of their things a mile off from their habitation when they had done this they pulled up all the young trees which the poor men had planted pulled up the enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their corn and in a word sacked and plundered every thing as completely as a herd of tartars would have done the two men were at this juncture gone to find them out and had resolved to fight them wherever they had been though they were but two to three so that had they met there certainly would have been bloodshed among them for they were all very stout resolute fellows to give them their due but providence took more care to keep them asunder than they themselves could do to meet for as they had dogged one another when the three were gone thither the two were here and afterwards when the two went back to find them the three were come to the old habitation again we shall see their differing conduct presently when the three came back like furious creatures flushed with the rage which the work they had been about put them into they came up to the spaniards and told them what they had done by way of scoff and bravado and one of them stepping up to one of the spaniards as if they had been a couple of boys at play takes hold of his hat as it was upon his head and giving it a twirl about jeering in his face says he to him and you seignior jack spaniard shall have the same sauce if you do not mend your manners the spaniard who though quite a civil man was as brave as a man could desire to be and withal a strong well made man looked steadily at him for a good while and then having no weapon in his hand stepped gravely up to him and with one blow of his fist knocked him down as an ox is felled with a pole axe at which one of the rogues insolent as the first fixed his pistol at the spaniard immediately he missed his body indeed for the bullets went through his hair but one of them touched the tip of his ear and he bled pretty much the blood made the spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really was and that put him into some heat for before he acted all in a perfect calm but now resolving to go through with his work he stooped and took the fellow s musket whom he had knocked down and was just going to shoot the man who had fired at him when the rest of the spaniards being in the cave came out and calling to him not to shoot they stepped in secured the other two and took their arms from them when they were thus disarmed and found they had made all the spaniards their enemies as well as their own countrymen they began to cool and giving the spaniards better words would have had their arms again but the spaniards considering the feud that was between them and the other two englishmen and that it would be the best method they could take to keep them from one another told them they would do them no harm and if they would live peaceably they would be very willing to assist and associate with them as they did before but that they could not think of giving them their arms again while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own countrymen and had even threatened them all to make them their servants the rogues were now more capable to hear reason than to act reason but being refused their arms they went raving away and raging like madmen threatening what they would do though they had no fire arms but the spaniards despising their threatening told them they should take care how they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle for if they did they would shoot them as they would do ravenous beasts wherever they found them and if they fell into their hands alive they would certainly be hanged however this was far from cooling them but away they went swearing and raging like furies of hell as soon as they were gone came back the two men in passion and rage enough also though of another kind for having been at their plantation and finding it all demolished and destroyed as above it will easily be supposed they had provocation enough they could scarce have room to tell their tale the spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs and it was strange enough to find that three men should thus bully nineteen and receive no punishment at all the spaniards indeed despised them and especially having thus disarmed them made light of their threatenings but the two englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them what pains soever it cost to find them out but the spaniards interposed here too and told them that they were already disarmed they could not consent that they the two should pursue them with fire arms and perhaps kill them but said the grave spaniard who was their governor we will endeavour to make them do you justice if you will leave it to us for as there is no doubt but they will come to us again when their passion is over being not able to subsist without our assistance we promise you to make no peace with them without having full satisfaction for you and upon this condition we hope you will promise to use no violence with them other than in your defence the two englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly and with great reluctance but the spaniards protested they did it only to keep them from bloodshed and to make all easy at last for said they we are not so many of us here is room enough for us all and it is great pity we should not be all good friends at length they did consent and waited for the issue of the thing living for some days with the spaniards for their own habitation was destroyed in about five days time the three vagrants tired with wandering and almost starved with hunger having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while came back to the grove and finding my spaniard who as i have said was the governor and two more with him walking by the side of the creek they came up in a very submissive humble manner and begged to be received again into the family the spaniards used them civilly but told them they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen and so very grossly by them the spaniards that they could not come to any conclusion without consulting the two englishmen and the rest but however they would go to them and discourse about it and they should know in half an hour it may be guessed that they were very hard put to it for as they were to wait this half hour for an answer they begged they would send them out some bread in the meantime which they did sending at the same time a large piece of goat s flesh and a boiled parrot which they ate very eagerly after half an hour s consultation they were called in and a long debate ensued their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their labour and a design to murder them all which they owned before and therefore could not deny now upon the whole the spaniards acted the moderators between them and as they had obliged the two englishmen not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellows two huts one to be of the same and the other of larger dimensions than they were before to fence their ground again plant trees in the room of those pulled up dig up the land again for planting corn and in a word to restore everything to the same state as they found it that is as near as they could well they submitted to all this and as they had plenty of provisions given them all the while they grew very orderly and the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together again only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work i mean for themselves except now and then a little just as they pleased however the spaniards told them plainly that if they would but live sociably and friendly together and study the good of the whole plantation they would be content to work for them and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased and thus having lived pretty well together for a month or two the spaniards let them have arms again and gave them liberty to go abroad with them as before it was not above a week after they had these arms and went abroad before the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome as ever however an accident happened presently upon this which endangered the safety of them all and they were obliged to lay by all private resentments and look to the preservation of their lives it happened one night that the governor the spaniard whose life i had saved who was now the governor of the rest found himself very uneasy in the night and could by no means get any sleep he was perfectly well in body only found his thoughts tumultuous his mind ran upon men fighting and killing one another but he was broad awake and could not by any means get any sleep in short he lay a great while but growing more and more uneasy he resolved to rise as they lay being so many of them on goat skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves so they had little to do when they were willing to rise but to get upon their feet and perhaps put on a coat such as it was and their pumps and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts guided them being thus got up he looked out but being dark he could see little or nothing and besides the trees which i had planted and which were now grown tall intercepted his sight so that he could only look up and see that it was a starlight night and hearing no noise he returned and lay down again but to no purpose he could not compose himself to anything like rest but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy and he knew not for what having made some noise with rising and walking about going out and coming in another of them waked and calling asked who it was that was up the governor told him how it had been with him say you so says the other spaniard such things are not to be slighted i assure you there is certainly some mischief working says he near us and presently he asked him where are the englishmen they are all in their huts says he safe enough it seems the spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment and had made a place where the three englishmen since their last mutiny always quartered by themselves and could not come at the rest well says the spaniard there is something in it i am persuaded from my own experience i am satisfied our spirits embodied have converse with and receive intelligence from the spirits unembodied and inhabiting the invisible world and this friendly notice is given for our advantage if we know how to make use of it come says he let us go out and look abroad and if we find nothing at all in it to justify our trouble i ll tell you a story of the purpose that shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it in a word they went out to go to the top of the hill where i used to go but they being strong and in good company nor alone as i was used none of my cautions to go up by the ladder and then pulling it up after them to go up a second stage to the top but were going round through the grove unconcerned and unwary when they were surprised with seeing a light as of fire a very little way off from them and hearing the voices of men not of one or two but of a great number in all the discoveries i had made of the savage landing on the island it was my constant care to prevent them making the least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place and when by any necessity they came to know it they felt it so effectively that they that got away were scarce able to give any account of it for we disappeared as soon as possible nor did ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else except it were the three savages in our last encounter who jumped into the boat of whom i mentioned that i was afraid they should go home and bring more help whether it was the consequence of the escape of those men that so great a number came now together or whether they came ignorantly and by accident on their usual bloody errand the spaniards could not it seems understand but whatever it was it had been their business either to have concealed themselves and not have seen them at all much less to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in the place but to have fallen upon them so effectually as that not a man of them should have escaped which could only have been by getting in between them and their boats but this presence of mind was wanting to them which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while we need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him surprised with this sight ran back immediately and raised their fellows giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all in and they again as readily took the alarm but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they were but that they must all run out to see how things stood while it was dark indeed they were well enough and they had opportunity enough for some hours to view them by the light of three fires they had made at some distance from one another what they were doing they knew not and what to do themselves they knew not for first the enemy were too many and secondly they did not keep together but were divided into several parties and were on shore in several places the spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore they made no doubt but first or last some of them would chop in upon their habitation or upon some other place where they would see the tokens of inhabitants and they were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats which would have been little less than starving them if they should have been destroyed so the first thing they resolved upon was to dispatch three men away before it was light viz two spaniards and one englishman to drive all the goats away to the great valley where the cave was and if need were to drive them into the very cave itself could they have seen the savages all together in one body and at a distance from their canoes they resolved if there had been an hundred of them to have attacked them but that could not be obtained for there were some of them two miles off from the other and as it appeared afterwards were of two different nations after having mused a great while on the course they should take and beaten their brains in considering their present circumstances they resolved at last while it was dark to send the old savage friday s father out as a spy to learn if possible something concerning them as what they came for and what they intended to do and the like the old man readily undertook it and stripping himself quite naked as most of the savages were away he went after he had been gone an hour or two he brings word that he had been among them undiscovered that he found they were two parties and of two several nations who had war with one another and had had a great battle in their own country and that both sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight they were by mere chance landed in the same island for the devouring their prisoners and making merry but this coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth that they were in a great rage at one another and were so near that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear he did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody s being on the island but themselves he had hardly made an end of telling the story when they could perceive by the unusual noise they made that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight friday s father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to lie close and not be seen he told them their safety consisted in it and that they had nothing to do but to lie still and the savages would kill one another to their hands and the rest would go away and it was so to a tittle but it was impossible to prevail especially upon the englishmen their curiosity was so importunate upon their prudentials that they must run out and see the battle however they used some caution viz they did not go openly just by their own dwelling but went farther into the woods and placed themselves to advantage where they might securely see them manage the fight and as they thought not to be seen by them but it seems the savages did see them as we shall find hereafter the battle was very fierce and if i might believe the englishmen one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery of invincible spirits and of great policy in guiding the fight the battle they said held two hours before they could guess which party would be beaten but then that party which was nearest our people s habitation began to appear weakest and after some time more some of them began to fly and this put our men again into a great consternation lest any of those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter and thereby involuntarily discover the place and that by consequence the pursuers should do the like in search for them upon this they resolved that they would stand armed within the wall and whoever came into the grove they should sally out over the wall and kill them so that if possible not one should return to give an account of it they ordered also that it should be done with their swords or by knocking them down with the stock of the musket not by shooting them for fear of raising an alarm by the noise as they expected it fell out three of the routed army fled for life and crossing the creek ran directly into the place not in the least knowing whither they went but running as into a thick wood for shelter the scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within with this addition to our men s great satisfaction viz that the conquerors had not pursued them or seen which way they were gone upon this the spaniard governor a man of humanity would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives but sending three men out by the top of the hill ordered them to go round and come in behind them surprise and take them prisoners which was done the residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes and got off to sea the victors retired and made no pursuit or very little but drawing themselves into a body together gave two great screaming shouts which they suppose were by way of triumph and so the fight ended and the same day about three o clock in the afternoon they also marched to their canoes and thus the spaniards had their island again free to themselves their fright was over and they saw no savages in several years after after they were all gone the spaniards came out of their den and viewing the field of battle they found about two and thirty dead men upon the spot some were killed with great long arrows several of which were found sticking in their bodies but most of them were killed with their great wooden swords sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle and as many bows with a great many arrows these swords were great unwieldy things and they must be very strong men that used them most of those men that were killed with them had their heads mashed to pieces as we may say or as we call it in english their brains knocked out and several of their arms and legs broken so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury they found not one wounded man that was not stone dead for either they stay by their enemy till they have quite killed them or they carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with them this deliverance tamed our englishmen for a great while the sight had filled them with horror and the consequence appeared terrible to the last degree especially upon supposing that some time or other they should fall into the hands of those creatures who would not only kill them as enemies but kill them for food as we kill our cattle and they professed to me that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton though it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead had something in it so horrible that it nauseated their very stomachs made them sick when they thought of it and filled their minds with unusual terror that they were not themselves for some weeks after this as i said tamed even the three english brutes i have been speaking of and for a great while after they were very tractable and went about the common business of the whole society well enough planted sowed reaped and began to be all naturalized to the country but some time after this they fell all into such simple measures again as brought them into a great deal of trouble they had taken three prisoners as i had observed and these three being lusty stout young fellows they made them servants and taught them to work for them and as slaves they did well enough but they did not take their measures with them as i did by my man friday viz to begin with them upon the principle of having saved their lives and then instructed them in the rational principles of life much less of religion civilizing and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguings but as they gave them their food every day so they gave them their work too and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough but they failed in this by it that they never had them to assist them and fight for them as i had my man friday who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones but to come to the family part being all now good friends for common danger as i said above had effectually reconciled them they began to consider their general circumstances and the first thing that came under their consideration was whether seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island and that there were more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living and manifestly to their advantage they should not rather remove their habitation and plant in some more proper place for their safety and especially for the security of their cattle and corn upon this after long debate it was conceived that they should not remove their habitation because that some time or other they thought they might hear from their governor again meaning me and if i should send any one to seek them i would be sure to direct them on that side where if they should find the place demolished they would conclude the savages had killed us all and we were gone and so our supply would go away too but as to their corn and cattle they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave was where the land was as proper to both and where indeed there was land enough however upon second thoughts they altered one part of that resolution too and resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither and plant part of their corn there and so if one part was destroyed the other might be saved and one piece of prudence they used which it was very well they did viz that they never trusted these three savages which they had taken prisoners with knowing any thing of the plantation they had made in that valley or of any cattle they had there much less of the cave there which they kept in case of necessity as a safe retreat and thither they carried also the two barrels of powder which i had left them at my coming away but however they resolved not to change their habitation yet they agreed that as i had carefully covered it first with a wall and fortification and then with a grove of trees so seeing their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed of which they were now fully convinced they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than before to this purpose as i had planted trees or rather thrust in stakes which in time all grew to be trees for some good distance before the entrance into my apartment they went on in the same manner and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground from the trees i had set quite down to the side of the creek where as i said i landed my floats and even into the very ooze where the tide flowed not so much as leaving any place to land or any sign that there had been any landing thereabout these stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow as i had noted formerly they took care to have generally very much larger and taller than those which i had planted and placed them so very thick and close that when they had been three or four years grown there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the plantation as for that part which i had planted the trees were grown as thick as a man s thigh and among them they placed so many other short ones and so thick that in a word it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick and it was next to impossible to penetrate it but with a little army to cut it all down for a little dog could hardly get between the trees they stood so close but this was not all for they did the same by all the ground to the right hand and to the left and round even to the top of the hill leaving no way not so much as for themselves to come out but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill and then lifted up and placed again from the first stage up to the top which ladder when it was taken down nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them this was excellently well contrived nor was it less than what they afterwards found occasion for which served to convince me that as human prudence has authority of providence to justify it so it has doubtless the direction of providence to set it to work and would we listen carefully to the voice of it i am fully persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives are now by our own negligence subjected to but this by the way i return to the story they lived two years after this in perfect retirement and had no more visits from the savages they had indeed an alarm given them one morning which put them in a great consternation for some of the spaniards being out early one morning on the west side or rather end of the island which by the way was that end where i never went for fear of being discovered they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes of indians just coming on shore they made the best of their way home in hurry enough and giving the alarm to their comrades they kept close all that day and the next going out only at night to make observation but they had the good luck to be mistaken for wherever the savages went they did not land at that time on the island but pursued some other design and now they had another broil with the three englishmen one of which a most turbulent fellow being in a rage at one of the three slaves which i mentioned they had taken because the fellow had not done something right which he bid him do and seemed a little untractable in his shewing him drew a hatchet out of a frog belt in which he bore it by his side and fell upon him the poor savage not to correct him but to kill him one of the spaniards who was by seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet which he aimed at his head but struck into his shoulder so that he thought he had cut the poor creature s arm off ran to him and entreating him not to murder the poor man clapt in between him and the savage to prevent the mischief the fellow being enraged the more at this struck at the spaniard with his hatchet and swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage which the spaniard perceiving avoided the blow and with a shovel which he had in his hand for they were working in the field about the corn land knocked the brute down another of the englishmen running at the same time to help his comrade knocked the spaniard down and then two spaniards more came to help their man and a third englishman fell upon them they had none of them any fire arms or any other weapons but hatchets and other tools except the third englishman he had one of my old rusty cutlasses with which he made at the last spaniards and wounded them both this fray set the whole family in an uproar and more help coming in they took the three englishmen prisoners the next question was what should be done with them they had been so often mutinous and were so furious so desperate and so idle withal that they knew not what course to take with them for they were mischievous to the highest degree and valued not what hurt they did any man so that in short it was not safe to live with them the spaniard who was governor told them in so many words that if they had been his own countrymen he would have hanged them all for all laws and all governors were to preserve society and those who were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it but as they were englishmen and that it was to the generous kindness of an englishman that they all owed their preservation and deliverance he would use them with all possible lenity and would leave them to the judgment of the other two englishmen who were their countrymen one of the two honest englishmen stood up and said they desired it might not be left to them for says he i am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows and with that gives an account how will atkins one of the three had proposed to have all the five englishmen join together and murder all the spaniards when they were in their sleep when the spanish governor heard this he calls to will atkins how seignior atkins says he will you murder us all what have you to say to that that hardened villain was so far from denying it that he said it was true and g d d mn him they would do it still before they had done with them well but seignior atkins said the spaniard what have we done to you that you will kill us and what would you get by killing us and what must we do to prevent your killing us must we kill you or will you kill us why will you put us to the necessity of this seignior atkins says the spaniard very calmly and smiling seignior atkins was in such a rage at the spaniard s making a jest of it that had he not been held by three men and withal had no weapons with him it was thought he would have attempted to have killed the spaniard in the middle of all the company this harebrained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done the two englishmen and the spaniard who saved the poor savage were of the opinion that they should hang one of the three for an example to the rest and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet and indeed there was some reason to believe he had done it for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had received that it was thought he could not live but the governor spaniard still said no it was an englishman that had saved all their lives and he would never consent to put an englishman to death though he had murdered half of them nay he said if he had been killed himself by an englishman and had time left to speak it should be that they should pardon him this was so positively insisted on by the governor spaniard that there was no gainsaying it and as merciful counsels are most apt to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed so they all came into it but then it was to be considered what should be done to keep them from the mischief they designed for all agreed governor and all that means were to be used for preserving the society from danger after a long debate it was agreed first that they should be disarmed and not permitted to have either gun or powder or shot or sword or any weapon and should be turned out of the society and left to live where they would and how they could by themselves but that none of the rest either spaniards or english should converse with them speak with them or have any thing to do with them that they should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt and that if they offered to commit any disorder so as to spoil burn kill or destroy any of the corn plantings buildings fences or cattle belonging to the society that they should die without mercy and would shoot them wherever they could find them the governor a man of great humanity musing upon the sentence considered a little upon it and turning to the two honest englishmen said hold you must reflect that it will be long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own and they must not starve we must therefore allow them provisions so he caused to be added that they should have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight months and for seed to sow by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their own that they should have six milch goats four he goats and six kids given them as well for present subsistence as for a store and that they should have tools given them for their work in the field such as six hatchets an axe a saw and the like but they should have none of these tools or provisions unless they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the spaniards with them or of their fellow englishmen thus they dismissed them the society and turned them out to shift for themselves they went away sullen and refractory as neither contented to go away or to stay but as there was no remedy they went pretending to go and choose a place where they should settle themselves to plant and live by themselves and some provisions were given but no weapons about four or five days after they came again for some victuals and gave the governor an account where they had pitched their tents and marked themselves out an habitation or plantation it was a very convenient place indeed on the remotest part of the island n e much about the place where i providentially landed in my first voyage when i was driven out to sea the lord alone knows whither in my foolish attempt to surround the island here they built themselves two handsome huts and contrived them in a manner like my first habitation being close under the side of a hill having some trees growing already to the three sides of it so that by planting others it would be very easily covered from the sight unless narrowly searched for they desired some dry goat skins for beds and covering which were given them and upon their giving their words that they would not disturb the rest or injure any of their plantations they gave them hatchets and what other tools they could spare some peas barley and rice for sowing and in a word any thing they wanted but arms and ammunition they lived in this separate condition about six months and had got in their first harvest though the quantity was but small the parcel of land they had planted being but little for indeed having all their plantation to form they had a great deal of work upon their hands and when they came to make boards and pots and such things they were quite out of their element and could make nothing of it and when the rainy season came on for want of a cave in the earth they could not keep their grain dry and it was in great danger of spoiling and this humbled them much so they came and begged the spaniards to help them which they very readily did and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them big enough to secure their corn and other things from the rain but it was but a poor place at best compared to mine and especially as mine was then for the spaniards had greatly enlarged it and made several new apartments in it about three quarters of a year after this separation a new frolic took these rogues which together with the former villany they had committed brought mischief enough upon them and had very near been the ruin of the whole colony the three new associates began it seems to be weary of the laborious life they led and that without hope of bettering their circumstances and a whim took them that they would make a voyage to the continent from whence the savages came and would try if they could not seize upon some prisoners among the natives there and bring them home so as to make them do the laborious part of the work for them the project was not so preposterous if they had gone no farther but they did nothing and proposed nothing but had either mischief in the design or mischief in the event and if i may give my opinion they seemed to be under a blast from heaven for if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes how shall we reconcile the events of things with divine justice it was certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they were in and as they shewed not the least remorse for the crime but added new villanies to it such as particularly that piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave because he did not or perhaps could not understand to do what he was directed and to wound him in such a manner as no question made him a cripple all his life and in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure and what was still worse the murderous intent or to do justice to the crime the intentional murder for such to be sure it was as was afterwards the formed design they all laid to murder the spaniards in cold blood and in their sleep but i leave observing and return to the story the three fellows came down to the spaniards one morning and in very humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them the spaniards very readily heard what they had to say which was this that they were tired of living in the manner they did that they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted and that having no help they found they should be starved but if the spaniards would give them leave to take one of the canoes which they came over in and give them arms and ammunition proportioned for their defence they would go over to the main and seek their fortune and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions the spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them but yet very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were running into told them they had suffered such hardships upon that very spot that they could without any spirit of prophecy tell them that they would be starved or murdered and bade them consider of it the men replied audaciously they should be starved if they stayed here for they could not work and would not work and they could but be starved abroad and if they were murdered there was an end of them they had no wives or children to cry after them and in short insisted importunately upon their demand declaring that they would go whether they would give them any arms or no the spaniards told them with great kindness that if they were resolved to go they should not go like naked men and be in no condition to defend themselves and that though they could ill spare their fire arms having not enough for themselves yet they would let them have two muskets a pistol and a cutlass and each man a hatchet which they thought sufficient for them in a word they accepted the offer and having baked them bread enough to serve them a month and given them as much goat s flesh as they could eat while it was sweet and a great basket full of dried grapes a pot full of fresh water and a young kid alive to kill they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea where it was at least forty miles broad the boat was indeed a large one and would have very well carried fifteen or twenty men and therefore was rather too big for them to manage but as they had a fair breeze and the flood tide with them they did well enough they had made a mast of a long pole and a sail of four large goat skins dried which they had sewed or laced together and away they went merrily enough the spaniards called after them bon veajo and no man ever thought of seeing them any more the spaniards would often say to one another and the two honest englishmen who remained behind how quietly and comfortably they lived now those three turbulent fellows were gone as for their ever coming again that was the remotest thing from their thoughts could be imagined when behold after twenty two days absence one of the englishmen being abroad upon his planting work sees three strange men coming towards him at a distance two of them with guns upon their shoulders away runs the englishman as if he was bewitched and became frighted and amazed to the governor spaniard and tells him they were all undone for there were strangers landed upon the island he could not tell who the spaniard pausing a while says to him how do you mean you cannot tell who they are savages to be sure no no says the englishman they are men in clothes with arms nay then says the spaniard why are you concerned if they are not savages they must be friends for there is no christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than harm while they were debating thus came the three englishmen and standing without the wood which was new planted hallooed to them they presently knew their voices and so all the wonder of that kind ceased but now the admiration was turned upon another question viz what could be the matter and what made them come back again it was not long before they brought the men in and inquiring where they had been and what they had been doing they gave them a full account of their voyage in a few words viz that they reached the land in two days or something less but finding the people alarmed at their coming and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them they durst not go on shore but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours till they came to a great opening by which they perceived that the land they saw from our island was not the main but an island that entering that opening of the sea they saw another island on the right hand north and several more west and being resolved to land somewhere they put over to one of the islands which lay west and went boldly on shore that they found the people were courteous and friendly to them and they gave them several roots and some dried fish and appeared very sociable and the women as well as the men were very forward to supply them with any thing they could get for them to eat and brought it to them a great way upon their heads they continued here four days and inquired as well as they could of them by signs what nations were this way and that way and were told of several fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way who as they made known by signs to them used to eat men but as for themselves they said that they never ate men or women except only such as they took in the wars and then they owned that they made a great feast and ate their prisoners the englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that kind and they told them two moons ago pointing to the moon and then to two fingers and that their great king had two hundred prisoners now which he had taken in his war and they were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast the englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those prisoners but the others mistaking them thought they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own eating so they beckoned to them pointing to the setting of the sun and then to the rising which was to signify that the next morning at sun rising they would bring some for them and accordingly the next morning they brought down five women and eleven men and gave them to the englishmen to carry with them on their voyage just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea port town to victual a ship as brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home their stomachs turned at this sight and they did not know what to do to refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the savage gentry that offered them and what to do with them they knew not however upon some debate they resolved to accept of them and in return they gave the savages that brought them one of their hatchets an old key a knife and six or seven of their bullets which though they did not understand they seemed extremely pleased with and then tying the poor creatures hands behind them they the people dragged the prisoners into the boat for our men the englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had them or else they that gave them his noble present would certainly have expected that they should have gone to work with them have killed two or three of them the next morning and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner but having taken their leave with all the respect and thanks that could well pass between people where on either side they understood not one word they could say they put off with their boat and came back towards the first island where when they arrived they set eight of their prisoners at liberty there being too many of them for their occasion in their voyage they endeavoured to have some communication with their prisoners but it was impossible to make them understand any thing nothing they could say to them or give them or do for them but was looked upon as going about to murder them they first of all unbound them but the poor creatures screamed at that especially the women as if they had just felt the knife at their throats for they immediately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed if they gave them any thing to eat it was the same thing then they concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh and so not be fat enough to kill if they looked at one of them more particularly the party presently concluded it was to see whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill first nay after they had brought them quite over and began to use them kindly and treat them well still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper for their new masters when the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or journal of their voyage the spaniard asked them where their new family was and being told that they had brought them on shore and put them into one of their huts and were come to beg some victuals for them they the spaniards and the other two englishmen that is to say the whole colony resolved to go all down to the place and see them and did so and friday s father with them when they came into the hut there they sat all bound for when they had brought them on shore they bound their hands that they might not take the boat and make their escape there i say they sat all of them stark naked first there were three men lusty comely fellows well shaped straight and fair limbs about thirty or thirty five years of age and five women whereof two might be from thirty to forty two more not above twenty four or twenty five and the fifth a tall comely maiden about sixteen or seventeen the women were well favoured agreeable persons both in shape and features only tawny and two of them had they been perfect white would have passed for handsome women even in london itself having very pleasant agreeable countenances and of a very modest behaviour especially when they came afterwards to be clothed and dressed as they called it though that dress was very indifferent it must be confessed of which hereafter the sight you may be sure was something uncouth to our spaniards who were to give them a just character men of the best behaviour of the most calm sedate tempers and perfect good humour that ever i met with and in particular of the most modesty as will presently appear i say the sight was very uncouth to see three naked men and five naked women all together bound and in the most miserable circumstances that human nature could be supposed to be viz to be expecting every moment to be dragged out and have their brains knocked out and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty the first thing they did was to cause the old indian friday s father to go in and see first if he knew any of them and then if he understood any of their speech as soon as the old man came in he looked seriously at them but knew none of them neither could any of them understand a word he said or a sign he could make except one of the women however this was enough to answer the end which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were christians that they abhorred eating of men or women and that they might be sure they would not be killed as soon as they were assured of this they discovered such a joy and by such awkward and several ways as is hard to describe for it seems they were of several nations the woman who was their interpreter was bid in the next place to ask them if they were willing to be servants and to work for the men who had brought them away to save their lives at which they all fell a dancing and presently one fell to taking up this and another that any thing that lay next to carry on their shoulders to intimate that they were willing to work the governor who found that the having women among them would presently be attended with some inconveniency and might occasion some strife and perhaps blood asked the three men what they intended to do with these women and how they intended to use them whether as servants or as women one of the englishmen answered very boldly and readily that they would use them as both to which the governor said i am not going to restrain you from it you are your own masters as to that but this i think is but just for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you and i desire it of you for that reason only viz that you will all engage that if any of you take any of these women as a woman or wife he shall take but one and that having taken one none else should touch her for though we cannot marry any of you yet it is but reasonable that while you stay here the woman any of you takes should be maintained by the man that takes her and should be his wife i mean says he while he continues here and that none else should have any thing to do with her all this appeared so just that every one agreed to it without any difficulty then the englishmen asked the spaniards if they designed to take any of them but every one answered no some of them said they had wives in spain and the others did not like women that were not christians and all together declared that they would not touch one of them which was an instance of such virtue as i have not met with in all my travels on the other hand to be short the five englishmen took them every one a wife that is to say a temporary wife and so they set up a new form of living for the spaniards and friday s father lived in my old habitation which they had enlarged exceedingly within the three servants which they had taken in the late battle of the savages lived with them and these carried on the main part of the colony supplying all the rest with food and assisting them in any thing as they could or as they found necessity required but the wonder of this story was how five such refractory ill matched fellows should agree about these women and that two of them should not pitch upon the same woman especially seeing two or three of them were without comparison more agreeable than the others but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves for they set the five women by themselves in one of their huts and they went all into the other hut and drew lots among them who should choose first he that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where the poor naked creatures were and fetched out her he chose and it was worth observing that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the five which made mirth enough among the rest and even the spaniards laughed at it but the fellow considered better than any of them that it was application and business that they were to expect assistance in as much as any thing else and she proved the best wife in the parcel when the poor women saw themselves in a row thus and fetched out one by one the terrors of their condition returned upon them again and they firmly believed that they were now going to be devoured accordingly when the english sailor came in and fetched out one of them the rest set up a most lamentable cry and hung about her and took their leave of her with such agonies and such affection as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world nor was it possible for the englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be immediately murdered till they fetched the old man friday s father who instantly let them know that the five men who had fetched them out one by one had chosen them for their wives when they had done this and the fright the women were in was a little over the men went to work and the spaniards came and helped them and in a few hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart for those they had already were crowded with their tools household stuff and provisions the three wicked ones had pitched farthest off and the two honest ones nearer but both on the north shore of the island so that they continued separate as before and thus my island was peopled in three places and as i might say three towns were begun to be planted and here it is very well worth observing that as it often happens in the world what the wise ends of god s providences are in such a disposition of things i cannot say the two honest fellows had the two worst wives and the three reprobates that were scarce worth hanging that were fit for nothing and neither seemed born to do themselves good or any one else had three clever diligent careful and ingenious wives not that the two first were ill wives as to their temper or humour for all the five were most willing quiet passive and subjected creatures rather like slaves than wives but my meaning is they were not alike capable ingenious or industrious or alike cleanly and neat another observation i must make to the honour of a diligent application on the one hand and to the disgrace of a slothful negligent idle temper on the other that when i came to the place and viewed the several improvements planting and management of the several little colonies the two men had so far out gone the three that there was no comparison they had indeed both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted and the reason was because according to my rule nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn than they wanted but the difference of the cultivation of the planting of the fences and indeed every thing else was easy to be seen at first view the two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts that when you came to the place nothing was to be seen but a wood and though they had their plantation twice demolished once by their own countrymen and once by the enemy as shall be shewn in its place yet they had restored all again and every thing was flourishing and thriving about them they had grapes planted in order and managed like a vineyard though they had themselves never seen any thing of that kind and by their good ordering their vines their grapes were as good again as any of the others they had also formed themselves a retreat in the thickest part of the woods where though there was not a natural cave as i had found yet they made one with incessant labour of their hands and where when the mischief which followed happened they secured their wives and children so as they could never be found they having by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood which as i said grow so easily made a grove impassable except in one place where they climbed up to get over the outside part and then went in by ways of their own leaving as to the three reprobates as i justly call them though they were much civilized by their new settlement compared to what they were before and were not so quarrelsome having not the same opportunity yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mind never left them and that was their idleness it is true they planted corn and made fences but solomon s words were never better verified than in them i went by the vineyard of the slothful and it was overgrown with thorns for when the spaniards came to view their crop they could not see it in some places for weeds the hedge had several gaps in it where the wild goats had gotten in and eaten up the corn perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in to stop them out for the present but it was only shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen whereas when they looked on the colony of the other two here was the very face of industry and success upon all they did there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn or a gap in any of their hedges and they on the other hand verified solomon s words in another place the diligent hand maketh rich for every thing grew and thrived and they had plenty within and without they had more tame cattle than the others more utensils and necessaries within doors and yet more pleasure and diversion too it is true the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within doors and having learnt the english ways of dressing and cooking from one of the other englishmen who as i said was a cook s mate on board the ship they dressed their husbands victuals very nicely whereas the other could not be brought to understand it but then the husband who as i said had been cook s mate did it himself but as for the husbands of the three wives they loitered about fetched turtles eggs and caught fish and birds in a word any thing but labour and they fared accordingly the diligent lived well and comfortably and the slothful lived hard and beggarly and so i believe generally speaking it is all over the world but now i come to a scene different from all that had happened before either to them or me and the origin of the story was this early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of indians or savages call them which you please and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves but that part was now so familiar to the spaniards and to our men too that they did not concern themselves about it as i did but having been made sensible by their experience that their only business was to lie concealed and that if they were not seen by any of the savages they would go off again quietly when the business was done having as yet not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the island i say having been made sensible of this they had nothing to do but to give notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors and not to shew themselves only placing a scout in a proper place to give notice when the boats went off to sea again this was without doubt very right but a disaster spoiled all these measures and made it known among the savages that there were inhabitants there which was in the end the desolation of almost the whole colony after the canoes with the savages were gone off the spaniards peeped abroad again and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been to see what they had been doing here to their great surprise they found three savages left behind and lying fast asleep upon the ground it was supposed they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast that like beasts they were asleep and would not stir when the others went or they were wandered into the woods and did not come back in time to be taken in the spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight and perfectly at a loss what to do the spaniard governor as it happened was with them and his advice was asked but he professed he knew not what to do as for slaves they had enough already and as to killing them they were none of them inclined to that the spaniard governor told me they could not think of shedding innocent blood for as to them the poor creatures had done no wrong invaded none of their property and they thought they had no just quarrel against them to take away their lives and here i must in justice to these spaniards observe that let all the accounts of spanish cruelty in mexico and peru be what they will i never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever in any foreign country who were so universally modest temperate virtuous so very good humoured and so courteous as these spaniards and as to cruelty they had nothing of it in their very nature no inhumanity no barbarity no outrageous passions and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the insufferable usage of the three englishmen and their justice and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages as above after some consultation they resolved upon this that they would lie still a while longer till if possible these three men might be gone but then the governor spaniard recollected that the three savages had no boat and that if they were left to rove about the island they would certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it and so they should be undone that way upon this they went back again and there lay the fellows fast asleep still so they resolved to awaken them and take them prisoners and they did so the poor fellows were strangely frighted when they were seized upon and bound and afraid like the women that they should be murdered and eaten for it seems those people think all the world do as they do eating mens flesh but they were soon made easy as to that and away they carried them it was very happy for them that they did not carry them home to their castle i mean to my palace under the hill but they carried them first to the bower where was the chief of their country work such as the keeping the goats the planting the corn c and afterwards they carried them to the habitation of the two englishmen here they were set to work though it was not much they had for them to do and whether it was by negligence in guarding them or that they thought the fellows could not mend themselves i know not but one of them ran away and taking into the woods they could never hear of him more they had good reason to believe he got home again soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards and who carrying on their revels as usual went off again in two days time this thought terrified them exceedingly for they concluded and that not without good cause indeed that if this fellow got safe home among his comrades he would certainly give them an account that there were people in the island as also how weak and few they were for this savage as i observed before had never been told as it was very happy he had not how many they were or where they lived nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns much less had they shewn him any other of their retired places such as the cave in the valley or the new retreat which the two englishmen had made and the like the first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelligence of them was that about two months after this six canoes of savages with about seven or eight or ten men in a canoe came rowing along the north side of the island where they never used to come before and landed about an hour after sunrise at a convenient place about a mile from the habitation of the two englishmen where this escaped man had been kept as the spaniard governor said had they been all there the damage would not have been so much for not a man of them would have escaped but the case differed now very much for two men to fifty were too much odds the two men had the happiness to discover them about a league off so that it was about an hour before they landed and as they landed about a mile from their huts it was some time before they could come at them now having great reason to believe that they were betrayed the first thing they did was to bind the slaves which were left and cause two of the three men whom they brought with the women who it seems proved very faithful to them to lead them with their two wives and whatever they could carry away with them to their retired place in the woods which i have spoken of above and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard farther in the next place seeing the savages were all come on shore and that they bent their course directly that way they opened the fences where their milch goats were kept and drove them all out leaving their goats to straggle into the wood whither they pleased that the savages might think they were all bred wild but the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that and gave them an account of it all for they went directly to the place when the poor frighted men had secured their wives and goods they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with the women and who was at their place by accident away to the spaniards with all speed to give them the alarm and desire speedy help and in the mean time they took their arms and what ammunition they had and retreated towards the place in the wood where their wives were sent keeping at a distance yet so that they might see if possible which way the savages took they had not gone far but that from a rising ground they could see the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation and in a moment more could see all their huts and household stuff flaming up together to their great grief and mortification for they had a very great loss and to them irretrievable at least for some time they kept their station for a while till they found the savages like wild beasts spread themselves all over the place rummaging every way and every place they could think of in search for prey and in particular for the people of whom it plainly appeared they had intelligence the two englishmen seeing this thinking themselves not secure where they stood as it was likely some of the wild people might come that way so they might come too many together thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile farther believing as it afterwards happened that the farther they strolled the fewer would be together the next halt was at the entrance into a very thick grown part of the woods and where an old trunk of a tree stood which was hollow and vastly large and in this tree they both took their standing resolving to see what might offer they had not stood there long but two of the savages appeared running directly that way as if they had already notice where they stood and were coming up to attack them and a little way farther they espied three more coming after them and five more beyond them all coming the same way besides which they saw seven or eight more at a distance running another way for in a word they ran every way like sportsmen beating for their game the poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand and keep their posture or fly but after a very short debate with themselves they considered that if the savages ranged the country thus before help came they might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods and then all would be lost so they resolved to stand them there and if there were too many to deal with then they would get to the top of the tree from whence they doubted not to defend themselves fire excepted as long as their ammunition lasted though all the savages that were landed which were near fifty were to attack them having resolved upon this they next considered whether they should fire at the two first or wait for the three and so take the middle party by which the two and the five that followed would be separated at length they resolved to let the two first pass by unless they should spy them in the tree and come to attack them the two first savages also confirmed them in this resolution by turning a little from them towards another part of the wood but the three and the five after them came forwards directly to the tree as if they had known the englishmen were there seeing them come so straight towards them they resolved to take them in a line as they came and as they resolved to fire but one at a time perhaps the first shot might hit them all three to which purpose the man who was to fire put three or four bullets into his piece and having a fair loop hole as it were from a broken hole in the tree he took a sure aim without being seen waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree so that he could not miss while they were thus waiting and the savages came on they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped from them and they both knew him distinctly and resolved that if possible he should not escape though they should both fire so the other stood ready with his piece that if he did not drop at the first shot he should be sure to have a second but the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim for as the savages kept near one another a little behind in a line he fired and hit two of them directly the foremost was killed outright being shot in the head the second which was the runaway indian was shot through the body and fell but was not quite dead and the third had a little scratch in the shoulder perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of the second and being dreadfully frightened though not so much hurt sat down upon the ground screaming and yelling in a hideous manner the five that were behind more frightened with the noise than sensible of the danger stood still at first for the woods made the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was the echoes rattling from one side to another and the fowls rising from all parts screaming and every sort making a different noise according to their kind just as it was when i fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot off in the island however all being silent again and they not knowing what the matter was came on unconcerned till they came to the place where their companions lay in a condition miserable enough here the poor ignorant creatures not sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief stood all together over the wounded man talking and as may be supposed inquiring of him how he came to be hurt and who it is very rational to believe told them that a flash of fire first and immediately after that thunder from their gods had killed those two and wounded him this i say is rational for nothing is more certain than that as they saw no man near them so they had never heard a gun in all their lives nor so much as heard of a gun neither knew they anything of killing and wounding at a distance with fire and bullets if they had one might reasonably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned to view the fate of their fellows without some apprehensions of their own our two men as they confessed to me were grieved to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures who had no notion of their danger yet having them all thus in their power and the first having loaded his piece again resolved to let fly both together among them and singling out by agreement which to aim at they shot together and killed or very much wounded four of them the fifth frightened even to death though not hurt fell with the rest so that our men seeing them all fall together thought they had killed them all the belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns which was a wrong step and they were under some surprise when they came to the place and found no less than four of them alive and of them two very little hurt and one not at all this obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets and first they made sure of the runaway savage that had been the cause of all the mischief and of another that was hurt in the knee and put them out of their pain then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them with his two hands held up and made piteous moans to them by gestures and signs for his life but could not say one word to them that they could understand however they made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by and one of the englishmen with a piece of rope yarn which he had by great chance in his pocket tied his two hands behind him and there they left him and with what speed they could made after the other two which were gone before fearing they or any more of them should find the way to their covered place in the woods where their wives and the few goods they had left lay they came once in sight of the two men but it was at a great distance however they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley towards the sea the quite contrary way from that which led to their retreat which they were afraid of and being satisfied with that they went back to the tree where they left their prisoner who as they supposed was delivered by his comrades for he was gone and the two pieces of rope yarn with which they had bound him lay just at the foot of the tree they were now in as great a concern as before not knowing what course to take or how near the enemy might be or in what numbers so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were to see if all was well there and to make them easy who were in fright enough to be sure for though the savages were their own country folks yet they were most terribly afraid of them and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of them when they came thither they found the savages had been in the wood and very near the place but had not found it for indeed it was inaccessible by the trees standing so thick as before unless the persons seeking it had been directed by those that knew it which these were not they found therefore every thing very safe only the women in a terrible fright while they were here they had the comfort of seven of the spaniards coming to their assistance the other ten with their servants and old friday i mean friday s father were gone in a body to defend their bower and the corn and cattle that were kept there in case the savages should have roved over to that side of the country but they did not spread so far with the seven spaniards came one of the savages who as i said were their prisoners formerly and with them also came the savage whom the englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the tree for it seems they came that way saw the slaughter of the seven men and unbound the eighth and brought him along with them where however they were obliged to bind him again us they had done the two others who were left when the third run away the prisoners began now to be a burden to them and they were so afraid of their escaping that they thought they were under an absolute necessity to kill them for their own preservation however the spaniard governor would not consent to it but ordered that they should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the valley and be kept there with two spaniards to guard them and give them food which was done and they were bound there hand and foot for that night when the spaniards came the two englishmen were so encouraged that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there but taking five of the spaniards and themselves with four muskets and a pistol among them and two stout quarter staves away they went in quest of the savages and first they came to the tree where the men lay that had been killed but it was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there for they attempted to carry their dead men away and had dragged two of them a good way but had given it over from thence they advanced to the first rising ground where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed and where they had the mortification still to see some of the smoke but neither could they here see any of the savages they then resolved though with all possible caution to go forward towards their ruined plantation but a little before they came thither coming in sight of the sea shore they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in their canoes in order to be gone they seemed sorry at first that there was no way to come at them to give them a parting blow but upon the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them the poor englishmen being now twice ruined and all their improvements destroyed the rest all agreed to come and help them to rebuild and to assist them with needful supplies their three countrymen who were not yet noted for having the least inclination to do any thing good yet as soon as they heard of it for they living remote knew nothing till all was over came and offered their help and assistance and did very friendly work for several days to restore their habitations and make necessaries for them and thus in a little time they were set upon their legs again about two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of seeing three of the savages canoes come driving onshore and at some distance from them with two drowned men by which they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at sea which had overset some of them for it blew very hard the night after they went off however as some might miscarry so on the other hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest as well of what they had done as of what happened to them and to whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature which they it seems resolved to attempt with sufficient force to carry all before them for except what the first man told them of inhabitants they could say little to it of their own knowledge for they never saw one man and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it they had no other witness to confirm it to them it was five or six months after this before they heard any more of the savages in which time our men were in hopes they had not forgot their former bad luck or had given over the hopes of better when on a sudden they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than twenty eight canoes full of savages armed with bows and arrows great clubs wooden swords and such like engines of war and they brought such numbers with them that in short it put all our people into the utmost consternation as they came on shore in the evening and at the easternmost side of the island our men had that night to consult and consider what to do and in the first place knowing that their being entirely concealed was their only safety before and would much more be so now while the number of their enemies was so great they therefore resolved first of all to take down the huts which were built for the two englishmen and drive away their goats to the old cave because they supposed the savages would go directly thither as soon as it was day to play the old game over again though they did not now land within two leagues of it in the next place they drove away all the flock of goats they had at the old bower as i called it which belonged to the spaniards and in short left as little appearance of inhabitants any where as possible and the next morning early they posted themselves with all their force at the plantation of the two men waiting for their coming as they guessed so it happened these new invaders leaving their canoes at the east end of the island came ranging along the shore directly towards the place to the number of two hundred and fifty as near as our men could judge our army was but small indeed but that which was worse they had not arms for all their number neither the whole account it seems stood thus first as to men 17 spaniards 5 englishmen 1 old friday or friday s father 3 slaves taken with the women who proved very faithful 3 other slaves who lived with the spaniards 29 to arm these they had 11 muskets 5 pistols 3 fowling pieces 5 muskets or fowling pieces which were taken by me from the mutinous seamen whom i reduced 2 swords 3 old halberts 29 to their slaves they did not give either musket or fusil but they had every one an halbert or a long staff like a quarter staff with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it and by his side a hatchet also every one of our men had hatchets two of the women could not be prevailed upon but they would come into the fight and they had bows and arrows which the spaniards had taken from the savages when the first action happened which i have spoken of where the indians fought with one another and the women had hatchets too the spaniard governor whom i have described so often commanded the whole and william atkins who though a dreadful fellow for wickedness was a most daring bold fellow commanded under him the savages came forward like lions and our men which was the worst of their fate had no advantage in their situation only that will atkins who now proved a most useful fellow with six men was planted just behind a small thicket of bushes as an advanced guard with orders to let the first of them pass by and then fire into the middle of them and as soon as he had fired to make his retreat as nimbly as he could round a part of the wood and so come in behind the spaniards where they stood having a thicket of trees all before them when the savages came on they ran straggling about every way in heaps out of all manner of order and will atkins let about fifty of them pass by him then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng he orders three of his men to fire having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece about as big as large pistol bullets how many they killed or wounded they knew not but the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among the savages who were frighted to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise and see their men killed and others hurt but see nobody that did it when in the middle of their fright william atkins and his other three let fly again among the thickest of them and in less than a minute the first three being loaded again gave them a third volley had william atkins and his men retired immediately as soon as they had fired as they were ordered to do or had the rest of the body been at hand to have poured in their shot continually the savages had been effectually routed for the terror that was among them came principally from this viz that they were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning and could see nobody that hurt them but william atkins staying to load again discovered the cheat some of the savages who were at a distance spying them came upon them behind and though atkins and his men fired at them also two or three times and killed above twenty retiring as fast as they could yet they wounded atkins himself and killed one of his fellow englishmen with their arrows as they did afterwards one spaniard and one of the indian slaves who came with the women this slave was a most gallant fellow and fought most desperately killing five of them with his own hand having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a hatchet our men being thus hard laid at atkins wounded and two other men killed retreated to a rising ground in the wood and the spaniards after firing three vollies upon them retreated also for their number was so great and they were so desperate that though above fifty of them were killed and more than so many wounded yet they came on in the teeth of our men fearless of danger and shot their arrows like a cloud and it was observed that their wounded men who were not quite disabled were made outrageous by their wounds and fought like madmen when our men retreated they left the spaniard and the englishman that were killed behind them and the savages when they came up to them killed them over again in a wretched manner breaking their arms legs and heads with their clubs and wooden swords like true savages but finding our men were gone they did not seem inclined to pursue them but drew themselves up in a kind of ring which is it seems their custom and shouted twice in token of their victory after which they had the mortification to see several of their wounded men fall dying with the mere loss of blood the spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon a rising ground atkins though he was wounded would have had him march and charge them again all together at once but the spaniard replied seignior atkins you see how their wounded men fight let them alone till morning all these wounded men will be stiff and sore with their wounds and faint with the loss of blood and so we shall have the fewer to engage the advice was good but will atkins replied merrily that s true seignior and so shall i too and that s the reason i would go on while i am warm well seignior atkins says the spaniard you have behaved gallantly and done your part we will fight for you if you cannot come on but i think it best to stay till morning so they waited but as it was a clear moonlight night and they found the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men and a great hurry and noise among them where they lay they afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night especially if they could come to give them but one volley before they were discovered this they had a fair opportunity to do for one of the two englishmen in whose quarter it was where the fight began led them round between the woods and the sea side westward and turning short south they came so near where the thickest of them lay that before they were seen or heard eight of them fired in among them and did dreadful execution upon them in half a minute more eight others fired after them pouring in their small shot in such a quantity that abundance were killed and wounded and all this while they were not able to see who hurt them or which way to fly the spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition and then divided themselves into three bodies and resolved to fall in among them all together they had in each body eight persons that is to say twenty four whereof were twenty two men and the two women who by the way fought desperately they divided the fire arms equally in each party and so of the halberts and staves they would have had the women keep back but they said they were resolved to die with their husbands having thus formed their little army they marched out from among the trees and came up to the teeth of the enemy shouting and hallooing as loud as they could the savages stood all together but were in the utmost confusion hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together they would have fought if they had seen us and as soon as we came near enough to be seen some arrows were shot and poor old friday was wounded though not dangerously but our men gave them no time but running up to them fired among them three ways and then fell in with the butt ends of their muskets their swords armed staves and hatchets and laid about them so well that in a word they set up a dismal screaming and howling flying to save their lives which way soever they could our men were tired with the execution and killed or mortally wounded in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them the rest being frighted out of their wits scoured through the woods and over the hills with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could help them to do and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them they got all together to the sea side where they landed and where their canoes lay but their disaster was not at an end yet for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the seaward so that it was impossible for them to put off nay the storm continuing all night when the tide came up their canoes were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it required infinite toil to get them off and some of them were even dashed to pieces against the beach or against one another our men though glad of their victory yet got little rest that night but having refreshed themselves as well as they could they resolved to march to that part of the island where the savages were fled and see what posture they were in this necessarily led them over the place where the fight had been and where they found several of the poor creatures not quite dead and yet past recovering life a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds for a truly great man though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy takes no delight in his misery however there was no need to give any order in this case for their own savages who were their servants dispatched those poor creatures with their hatchets at length they came in view of the place where the more miserable remains of the savages army lay where there appeared about one hundred still their posture was generally sitting upon the ground with their knees up towards their mouth and the head put between the hands leaning down upon the knees when our men came within two musket shot of them the spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without ball to alarm them this he did that by their countenance he might know what to expect viz whether they were still in heart to fight or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged and so he might manage accordingly this stratagem took for as soon as the savages heard the first gun and saw the flash of the second they started up upon their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable and as our men advanced swiftly towards them they all ran screaming and yawling away with a kind of an howling noise which our men did not understand and had never heard before and thus they ran up the hills into the country at first our men had much rather the weather had been calm and they had all gone away to sea but they did not then consider that this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted or at least to come so many and so often as would quite desolate the island and starve them will atkins therefore who notwithstanding his wound kept always with them proved the best counsellor in this case his advice was to take the advantage that offered and clap in between them and their boats and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any more to plague the island they consulted long about this and some were against it for fear of making the wretches fly into the woods and live there desperate and so they should have them to hunt like wild beasts be afraid to stir about their business and have their plantation continually rifled all their tame goats destroyed and in short be reduced to a life of continual distress will atkins told them they had better have to do with one hundred men than with one hundred nations that as they must destroy their boats so they must destroy the men or be all of them destroyed themselves in a word he shewed them the necessity of it so plainly that they all came into it so they went to work immediately with the boats and getting some dry wood together from a dead tree they tried to set some of them on fire but they were so wet that they would scarce burn however the fire so burned the upper part that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats when the indians saw what they were about some of them came running out of the woods and coming as near as they could to our men kneeled down and cried oa oa waramokoa and some other words of their language which none of the others understood any thing of but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises it was easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared and that they would be gone and never return thither again but our men were now satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves or to save their colony but effectually to prevent any of these people from ever going home again depending upon this that if ever so much as one of them got back into their country to tell the story the colony was undone so that letting them know that they should not have any mercy they fell to work with their canoes and destroyed them every one that the storm had not destroyed before at the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods which our people heard plain enough after which they ran about the island like distracted men so that in a word our men did not really know at first what to do with them nor did the spaniards with all their prudence consider that while they made those people thus desperate they ought to have kept good guard at the same time upon their plantations for though it is true they had driven away their cattle and the indians did not find their main retreat i mean my old castle at the hill nor the cave in the valley yet they found out my plantation at the bower and pulled it all to pieces and all the fences and planting about it trod all the corn under foot tore up the vines and grapes being just then almost ripe and did our men an inestimable damage though to themselves not one farthing s worth of service though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions yet they were in no condition to pursue them or hunt them up and down for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when they found them single so our men durst not go about single for fear of being surrounded with their numbers the best was they had no weapons for though they had bows they had no arrows left nor any materials to make any nor had they any edged tool or weapon among them the extremity and distress they were reduced to was great and indeed deplorable but at the same time our men were also brought to very hard circumstances by them for though their retreats were preserved yet their provision was destroyed and their harvest spoiled and what to do or which way to turn themselves they knew not the only refuge they had now was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave and some little corn which grew there the three englishmen william atkins and his comrades were now reduced to two one of them being killed by an arrow which struck him on the side of his head just under the temples so that he never spoke more and it was very remarkable that this was the same barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet and who afterwards intended to have murdered the spaniards i look upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine was at any time after i first discovered the grains of barley and rice and got into the method of planting and raising my corn and my tame cattle for now they had as i may say an hundred wolves upon the island which would devour every thing they could come at yet could be very hardly come at themselves the first thing they concluded when they saw what their circumstances were was that they would if possible drive them up to the farther part of the island south east that if any more savages came on shore they might not find one another then that they would daily hunt and harass them and kill as many of them as they could come at till they had reduced the number and if they could at last tame them and bring them to any thing they would give them corn and teach them how to plant and live upon their daily labour in order to this they followed them and so terrified them with their guns that in a few days if any of them fired a gun at an indian if he did not hit him yet he would fall down for fear and so dreadfully frighted they were that they kept out of sight farther and farther till at last our men following them and every day almost killing and wounding some of them they kept up in the woods and hollow places so much that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of food and many were afterwards found dead in the woods without any hurt but merely starved to death when our men found this it made their hearts relent and pity moved them especially the spaniard governor who was the most gentleman like generous minded man that ever i met with in my life and he proposed if possible to take one of them alive and bring him to understand what they meant so far as to be able to act as interpreter and to go among them and see if they might be brought to some conditions that might be depended upon to save their lives and do us no spoil it was some time before any of them could be taken but being weak and half starved one of them was at last surprised and made a prisoner he was sullen at first and would neither eat nor drink but finding himself kindly used and victuals given him and no violence offered him he at last grew tractable and came to himself they brought old friday to him who talked often with him and told him how kind the others would be to them all that they would not only save their lives but would give them a part of the island to live in provided they would give satisfaction that they should keep in their own bounds and not come beyond them to injure or prejudice others and that they should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for their bread and some bread given them for their present subsistence and old friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen and hear what they said to it assuring them that if they did not agree immediately they should all be destroyed the poor wretches thoroughly humbled and reduced in number to about thirty seven closed with the proposal at the first offer and begged to have some food given them upon which twelve spaniards and two englishmen well armed and three indian slaves and old friday marched to the place where they were the three indian slaves carried them a large quantity of bread and some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun and three live goats and they were ordered to go to the side of an hill where they sat down ate the provisions very thankfully and were the most faithful fellows to their words that could be thought of for except when they came to beg victuals and directions they never came out of their bounds and there they lived when i came to the island and i went to see them they had taught them both to plant corn make read breed tame goats and milk them they wanted nothing but wives and they soon would have been a nation they were confined to a neck of land surrounded with high rocks behind them and lying plain towards the sea before them on the south east corner of the island they had land enough and it was very good and fruitful for they had a piece of land about a mile and a half broad and three or four miles in length our men taught them to make wooden spades such as i made for myself and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four knives and there they lived the most subjected innocent creatures that were ever heard of after this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect to the savages till i came to revisit them which was in about two years not but that now and then some canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts but as they were of several nations and perhaps had never heard of those that came before or the reason of it they did not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen and if they had it would have been very hard for them to have found them out thus i think i have given a full account of all that happened to them to my return at least that was worth notice the indians or savages were wonderfully civilized by them and they frequently went among them but forbid on pain of death any of the indians coming to them because they would not have their settlement betrayed again one thing was very remarkable viz that they taught the savages to make wicker work or baskets but they soon outdid their masters for they made abundance of most ingenious things in wicker work particularly all sorts of baskets sieves bird cages cupboards c as also chairs to sit on stools beds couches and abundance of other things being very ingenious at such work when they were once put in the way of it my coming was a particular relief to these people because we furnished them with knives scissars spades shovels pickaxes and all things of that kind which they could want with the help of these tools they were so very handy that they came at last to build up their huts or houses very handsomely raddling or working it up like basket work all the way round which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity and looked very odd but was an exceeding good fence as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin and our men were so taken with it that they got the wild savages to come and do the like for them so that when i came to see the two englishmen s colonies they looked at a distance as if they lived all like bees in a hive and as for will atkins who was now become a very industrious necessary and sober fellow he had made himself such a tent of basket work as i believe was never seen it was one hundred and twenty paces round on the outside as i measured by my steps the walls were as close worked as a basket in pannels or squares thirty two in number and very strong standing about seven feet high in the middle was another not above twenty two paces round but built stronger being eight square in its form and in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts round the top of which he laid strong pieces joined together with wooden pins from which he raised a pyramid before the roof of eight rafters very handsome i assure you and joined together very well though he had no nails and only a few iron spikes which he had made himself too out of the old iron that i had left there and indeed this fellow shewed abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of he made himself a forge with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire he made himself charcoal for his work and he formed out of one of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon in this manner he made many things but especially hooks staples and spikes bolts and hinges but to return to the house after he pitched the roof of his innermost tent he worked it up between the rafters with basket work so firm and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice straw and over that a large leaf of a tree which covered the top that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated indeed he owned that the savages made the basket work for him the outer circuit was covered as a lean to all round his inner apartment and long rafters lay from the thirty two angles to the top posts of the inner house being about twenty feet distant so that there was a space like a walk within the outer wicker wall and without the inner near twenty feet wide the inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker work but much fairer and divided into six apartments for that he had six rooms on a floor and out of every one of these there was a door first into the entry or coming into the main tent and another door into the space or walk that was round it so that this walk was also divided into six equal parts which served not only for a retreat but to store up any necessaries which the family had occasion for these six spaces not taking up the whole circumference what other apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered as soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle you had a short passage straight before you to the door of the inner house but on either side was a wicker partition and a door in it by which you went first into a large room or storehouse twenty feet wide and about thirty feet long and through that into another not quite so long so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms six of which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner tent and served as closets or retired rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle and four large warehouses or barns or what you please to call them which went in through one another two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent such a piece of basket work i believe was never seen in the world nor an house or tent so neatly contrived much less so built in this great beehive lived the three families that is to say will atkins and his companions the third was killed but his wife remained with three children for she was it seems big with child when he died and the other two were not at all backward to give the widow her full share of every thing i mean as to their corn milk grapes c and when they killed a kid or found a turtle on the shore so that they all lived well enough though it was true they were not so industrious as the other two as has been observed already one thing however cannot be omitted viz that as for religion i don t know that there was any thing of that kind among them they pretty often indeed put one another in mind that there was a god by the very common method of seamen viz swearing by his name nor were their poor ignorant savage wives much the better for having been married to christians as we must call them for as they knew very little of god themselves so they were utterly incapable of entering into any discourse with their wives about a god or to talk any thing to them concerning religion the utmost of all the improvement which i can say the wives had made from them was that they had taught them to speak english pretty well and all the children they had which were near twenty in all were taught to speak english too from their first learning to speak though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner like their mothers there were none of those children above six years old when i came thither for it was not much above seven years that they had fetched these five savage ladies over but they had all been pretty fruitful for they had all children more or less i think the cook s mate s wife was big of her sixth child and the mothers were all a good sort of well governed quiet laborious women modest and decent helpful to one another mighty observant and subject to their masters i cannot call them husbands and wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the christian religion and to be legally married both which were happily brought about afterwards by my means or at least by the consequence of my coming among them having thus given an account of the colony in general and pretty much of my five runagate englishmen i must say something of the spaniards who were the main body of the family and in whose story there are some incidents also remarkable enough i had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances when they were among the savages they told me readily that they had no instances to give of their application or ingenuity in that country that they were a poor miserable dejected handful of people that if means had been put into their hands they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair and so sunk under the weight of their misfortunes that they thought of nothing but starving one of them a grave and very sensible man told me he was convinced they were in the wrong that it was not the part of wise men to give up themselves to their misery but always to take hold of the helps which reason offered as well for present support as for future deliverance he told me that grief was the most senseless insignificant passion in the world for that it regarded only things past which were generally impossible to he recalled or to be remedied but had no view to things to come and had no share in any thing that looked like deliverance but rather added to the affliction than proposed a remedy and upon this he repeated a spanish proverb which though i cannot repeat in just the same words that he spoke it yet i remember i made it into an english proverb of my own thus in trouble to be troubled is to have your trouble doubled he then ran on in remarks upon all the little improvements i had made in my solitude my unwearied application as he called it and how i had made a condition which in its circumstances was at first much worse than theirs a thousand times more happy than theirs was even now when they were all together he told me it was remarkable that englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their distress than any people that ever he met with that their unhappy nation and the portuguese were the worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes for that their first step in dangers after common efforts are over was always to despair lie down under it and die without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape i told him their case and mine differed exceedingly that they were cast upon the shore without necessaries without supply of food or of present sustenance till they could provide it that it is true i had this disadvantage and discomfort that i was alone but then the supplies i had providentially thrown into my hands by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore was such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to have applied himself as i had done seignior says the spaniard had we poor spaniards been in your case we should never have gotten half those things out of the ship as you did nay says he we should never have found means to have gotten a raft to carry them or to have gotten a raft on shore without boat or sail and how much less should we have done said he if any of us had been alone well i desired him to abate his compliment and go on with the history of their coming on shore where they landed he told me they unhappily landed at a place where there were people without provisions whereas had they had the common sense to have put off to sea again and gone to another island a little farther they had found provisions though without people there being an island that way as they had been told where there were provisions though no people that is to say that the spaniards of trinidad had frequently been there and filled the island with goats and hogs at several times where they have bred in such multitudes and where turtle and sea fowls were in such plenty that they could have been in no want of flesh though they had found no bread whereas here they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs which they understood not and which had no substance in them and which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough and who could treat them no better unless they would turn cannibals and eat men s flesh which was the great dainty of the country they gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize the savages they were with and to teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of living but in vain and how they retorted it upon them as unjust that they who came thither for assistance and support should attempt to set up for instructors of those that gave them bread intimating it seems that none should set up for the instructors of others but those who could live without them they gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to how sometimes they were many days without any food at all the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent and for that reason were less supplied with the necessaries of life than they had reason to believe others were in the same part of the world and yet they found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious than those who had better supplies of food also they added that they could not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of god directs the event of things in the world which they said appeared in their circumstances for if pressed by the hardships they were under and the barrenness of the country where they were they had searched after a better place to live in they had then been out of the way of the relief that happened to them by my means then they gave me an account how the savages whom they lived among expected them to go out with them into their wars and it was true that as they had fire arms with them had they not had the disaster to lose their ammunition they should not have been serviceable only to their friends but have made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies but being without powder and shot and in a condition that they could not in reason deny to go out with their landlords to their wars when they came in the field of battle they were in a worse condition than the savages themselves for they neither had bows nor arrows nor could they use those the savages gave them so that they could do nothing but stand still and be wounded with arrows till they came up to the teeth of their enemy and then indeed the three halberts they had were of use to them and they would often drive a whole little army before them with those halberts and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets but that for all this they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes and in great danger from their arrows till at last they found the way to make themselves large targets of wood which they covered with skins of wild beasts whose names they knew not and these covered them from the arrows of the savages that notwithstanding these they were sometimes in great danger and were once five of them knocked down together with the clubs of the savages which was the time when one of them was taken prisoner that is to say the spaniard whom i had relieved that at first they thought he had been killed but when afterwards they heard he was taken prisoner they were under the greatest grief imaginable and would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued him they told me that when they were so knocked down the rest of their company rescued them and stood over them fighting till they were come to themselves all but he who they thought had been dead and then they made their way with their halberts and pieces standing close together in a line through a body of above a thousand savages beating down all that came in their way got the victory over their enemies but to their great sorrow because it was with the loss of their friend whom the other party finding him alive carried off with some others as i gave an account in my former they described most affectionately how they were surprised with joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery who they thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind viz by wild men and yet how more and more they were surprised with the account he gave them of his errand and that there was a christian in a place near much more one that was able and had humanity enough to contribute to their deliverance they described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief i sent them and at the appearance of loaves of bread things they had not seen since their coming to that miserable place how often they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from heaven and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it as also of the other things i had sent for their supply and after all they would have told me something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to the person and place from whence all these new comforts came but they told me it was impossible to express it by words for their excessive joy driving them to unbecoming extravagancies they had no way to describe them but by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy having no way to give vent to their passion suitable to the sense that was upon them that in some it worked one way and in some another and that some of them through a surprise of joy would burst out into tears others be half mad and others immediately faint this discourse extremely affected me and called to my mind friday s ecstasy when he met his father and the poor people s ecstasy when i took them up at sea after their ship was on fire the mate of the ship s joy when he found himself delivered in the place where he expected to perish and my own joy when after twenty eight years captivity i found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country all these things made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men and more affected with it having thus given a view of the state of things as i found them i must relate the heads of what i did for these people and the condition in which i left them it was their opinion and mine too that they would be troubled no more with the savages or that if they were they would be able to cut them off if they were twice as many as before so that they had no concern about that then i entered into a serious discourse with the spaniard whom i called governor about their stay in the island for as i was not come to carry any of them off so it would not be just to carry off some and leave others who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished on the other hand i told them i came to establish them there not to remove them and then i let them know that i had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them that i had been at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary as well for their convenience as their defence and that i had such particular persons with me as well to increase and recruit their number as by the particular necessary employments which they were bred to being artificers to assist them in those things in which at present they were to seek they were all together when i talked thus to them and before i delivered to them the stores i had brought i asked them one by one if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had been among them and could shake hands with one another and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest so that there might be no more misunderstandings or jealousies william atkins with abundance of frankness and good humour said they had met with afflictions enough to make them all sober and enemies enough to make them all friends that for his part he would live and die with them and was so far from designing any thing against the spaniards that he owned they had done nothing to him but what his own bad humour made necessary and what he would have done and perhaps much worse in their case and that he would ask them pardon if i desired it for the foolish and brutish things he had done to them and was very willing and desirous of living on terms of entire friendship and union with them and would do any thing that lay in his power to convince them of it and as for going to england he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty years the spaniards said they had indeed at first disarmed and excluded william atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct as they had let me know and they appealed to me for the necessity they were under to do so but that william atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had with the savages and on several occasions since and had shewed himself so faithful to and concerned for the general interest of them all that they had forgotten all that was past and thought he merited as much to be trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them and that they had testified their satisfaction in him by committing the command to him next to the governor himself and as they had an entire confidence in him and all his countrymen so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance that they would never have any interest separate from one another upon these frank and open declarations of friendship we appointed the next day to dine all together and indeed we made a splendid feast i caused the ship s cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner and the old cook s mate we had on shore assisted we brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork out of the ship s provision with our punch bowl and materials to fill it and in particular i gave them ten bottles of french claret and ten bottles of english beer things that neither the spaniards nor the englishmen had tasted for many years and which it may be supposed they were exceeding glad of the spaniards added to our feast five whole kids which the cooks roasted and three of them were sent covered up close on board our ship to the seamen that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore as we did with their salt meal from on board after this feast at which we were very innocently merry i brought out my cargo of goods wherein that there might be no dispute about dividing i shewed them that there was sufficient for them all and desired that they might all take an equal quantity of the goods that were for wearing that is to say equal when made up as first i distributed linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts and at the spaniards request afterwards made them up six these were exceeding comfortable to them having been what as i may say they had long since forgot the use of or what it was to wear them i allotted the thin english stuffs which i mentioned before to make every one a light coat like a frock which i judged fittest for the heat of the season cool and loose and ordered that whenever they decayed they should make more as they thought fit the like for pumps shoes stockings and hats c i cannot express what pleasure what satisfaction sat upon the countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care i had taken of them and how well i had furnished them they told me i was a father to them and that having such a correspondent as i was in so remote a part of the world it would make them forget that they were left in a desolate place and they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place without my consent then i presented to them the people i had brought with me particularly the tailor the smith and the two carpenters all of them most necessary people but above all my general artificer than whom they could not name any thing that was more needful to them and the tailor to shew his concern for them went to work immediately and with my leave made them every one a shirt the first thing he did and which was still more he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch and use the needle but made them assist to make the shirts for their husbands and for all the rest as for the carpenters i scarce need mention how useful they were for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy things and made them clever convenient tables stools bedsteads cupboards lockers shelves and every thing they wanted of that kind but to let them see how nature made artificers at first i carried the carpenters to see william atkins s basket house as i called it and they both owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before nor any thing so regular and so handily built at least of its kind and one of them when he saw it after musing a good while turning about to me i am sure says he that man has no need of us you need do nothing but give him tools then i brought them out all my store of tools and gave every man a digging spade a shovel and a rake for we had no harrows or ploughs and to every separate place a pickaxe a crow a broadaxe and a saw always appointing that as often as any were broken or worn out they should be supplied without grudging out of the general stores that i left behind nails staples hinges hammers chisels knives scissors and all sorts of tools and iron work they had without tale as they required for no man would care to take more than he wanted and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account whatever and for the use of the smith i left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply my magazine of powder and arms which i brought them was such even to profusion that they could not but rejoice at them for now they could march as i used to do with a musket upon each shoulder if there was occasion and were able to fight a thousand savages if they had but some little advantages of situation which also they could not miss of if they had occasion i carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved to death and the maid also she was a sober well educated religious young woman and behaved so inoffensively that every one gave her a good word she had indeed an unhappy life with us there being no woman in the ship but herself but she bore it with patience after a while seeing things so well ordered and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island and considering that they had neither business nor acquaintance in the east indies or reason for taking so long a voyage i say considering all this both of them came to me and desired i would give them leave to remain on the island and be entered among my family as they called it i agreed to it readily and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them where they had three tents or houses set up surrounded with a basket work palisaded like atkins s and adjoining to his plantation their tents were contrived so that they had each of them a room a part to lodge in and a middle tent like a great storehouse to lay all their goods in and to eat and drink in and now the other two englishmen moved their habitation to the same place and so the island was divided into three colonies and no more viz the spaniards with old friday and the first servants at my old habitation under the hill which was in a word the capital city and where they had so enlarged and extended their works as well under as on the outside of the hill that they lived though perfectly concealed yet full at large never was there such a little city in a wood and so hid i believe in any part of the world for i verily believe a thousand men might have ranged the island a month and if they had not known there was such a thing and looked on purpose for it they would not have found it for the trees stood so thick and so close and grew so fast matted into one another that nothing but cutting them down first could discover the place except the two narrow entrances where they went in and out could be found which was not very easy one of them was just down at the water s edge on the side of the creek and it was afterwards above two hundred yards to the place and the other was up the ladder at twice as i have already formerly described it and they had a large wood thick planted also on the top of the hill which contained above an acre which grew apace and covered the place from all discovery there with only one narrow place between two trees not easy to be discovered to enter on that side the other colony was that of will atkins where there were four families of englishmen i mean those i had left there with their wives and children three savages that were slaves the widow and children of the englishman that was killed the young man and the maid and by the way we made a wife of her also before we went away there were also the two carpenters and the tailor whom i brought with me for them also the smith who was a very necessary man to them especially as the gunsmith to take care of their arms and my other man whom i called jack of all trades who was himself as good almost as twenty men for he was not only a very ingenious fellow but a very merry fellow and before i went away we married him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship whom i mentioned before and now i speak of marrying it brings me naturally to say something of the french ecclesiastic that i had brought with me out of the ship s crew whom i took at sea it is true this man was a roman and perhaps it may give offence to some hereafter if i leave any thing extraordinary upon record of a man whom before i begin i must to set him out in just colours represent in terms very much to his disadvantage in the account of protestants as first that he was a papist secondly a popish priest and thirdly a french popish priest but justice demands of me to give him a due character and i must say he was a grave sober pious and most religious person exact in his life extensive in his charity and exemplary in almost every thing he did what then can any one say against my being very sensible of the value of such a man notwithstanding his profession though it may be my opinion perhaps as well as the opinion of others who shall read this that he was mistaken the first hour that i began to converse with him after he had agreed to go with me to the east indies i found reason to delight exceedingly in his conversation and he first began with me about religion in the most obliging manner imaginable sir says he you have not only under god and at that he crossed his breast saved my life but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your ship and by your obliging civility have taken me into your family giving me an opportunity of free conversation now sir says he you see by my habit what my profession is and i guess by your nation what yours is i may think it is my duty and doubtless it is so to use my utmost endeavours on all occasions to bring all the souls that i can to the knowledge of the truth and to embrace the catholic doctrine but as i am here under your permission and in your family i am bound in justice to your kindness as well as in decency and good manners to be under your government and therefore i shall not without your leave enter into any debates on the points of religion in which we may not agree farther than you shall give me leave i told him his carriage was so modest that i could not but acknowledge it that it was true we were such people as they call heretics but that he was not the first catholic that i had conversed with without falling into any inconveniencies or carrying the questions to any height in debate that he should not find himself the worse used for being of a different opinion from us and if we did not converse without any dislike on either side upon that score it would be his fault not ours he replied that he thought our conversation might be easily separated from disputes that it was not his business to cap principles with every man he discoursed with and that he rather desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a religieux that if i would give him leave at any time to discourse upon religious subjects he would readily comply with it and that then he did not doubt but i would allow him also to defend his own opinions as well as he could but that without my leave he would not break in upon me with any such thing he told me farther that he would not cease to do all that became him in his office as a priest as well as a private christian to procure the good of the ship and the safety of all that was in her and though perhaps we would not join with him and he could not pray with us he hoped he might pray for us which he would do upon all occasions in this manner we conversed and as he was of a most obliging gentleman like behaviour so he was if i may be allowed to say so a man of good sense and as i believe of great learning he gave me a most diverting account of his life and of the many extraordinary events of it of many adventures which had befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world and particularly this was very remarkable viz that during the voyage he was now engaged in he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped and never to go to the place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed that his first intent was to have gone to martinico and that he went on board a ship bound thither at st maloes but being forced into lisbon in bad weather the ship received some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river tagus and was obliged to unload her cargo there that finding a portuguese ship there bound to the madeiras and ready to sail and supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there bound to martinico he went on board in order to sail to the madeiras but the master of the portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner had been out in his reckoning and they drove to fyal where however he happened to find a very good market for his cargo which was corn and therefore resolved not to go to the madeiras but to load salt at the isle of may to go away to newfoundland he had no remedy in the exigence but to go with the ship and had a pretty good voyage as far as the banks so they call the place where they catch the fish where meeting with a french ship bound from france to quebec in the river of canada and from thence to martinico to carry provisions he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first design but when he came to quebec the master of the ship died and the ship proceeded no farther so the next voyage he shipped himself for france in the ship that was burnt when we took them up at sea and then shipped them with us for the east indies as i have already said thus he had been disappointed in five voyages all as i may call it in one voyage besides what i shall have occasion to mention farther of the same person but i shall not make digressions into other men s stories which have no relation to my own i return to what concerns our affair in the island he came to me one morning for he lodged among us all the while we were upon the island and it happened to be just when i was going to visit the englishmen s colony at the farthest part of the island i say he came to me and told me with a very grave countenance that he had for two or three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with me which he hoped would not be displeasing to me because he thought it might in some measure correspond with my general design which was the prosperity of my new colony and perhaps might put it at least more than he yet thought it was in the way of god s blessing i looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse and turning a little short how sir said i can it be said that we are not in the way of god s blessing after such visible assistances and wonderful deliverances as we have seen here and of which i have given you a large account if you had pleased sir said he with a world of modesty and yet with great readiness to have heard me you would have found no room to have been displeased much less to think so hard of me that i should suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and deliverances and i hope on your behalf that you are in the way of god s blessing and your design is exceeding good and will prosper but sir said he though it were more so than is even possible to you yet there may be some among you that are not equally right in their actions and you know that in the story of israel one achan in the camp removed god s blessing from them and turned his hand so against them that thirty six of them though not concerned in the crime were the objects of divine vengeance and bore the weight of that punishment i was sensibly touched with this discourse and told him his inference was so just and the whole design seemed so sincere and was really so religious in its own nature that i was very sorry i had interrupted him and begged him to go on and in the meantime because it seemed that what we had both to say might take up some time i told him i was going to the englishmens plantation and asked him to go with me and we might discourse of it by the way he told me he would more willingly wait on me thither because there partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me about so we walked on and i pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he had to say why then sir says he be pleased to give me leave to lay down a few propositions as the foundation of what i have to say that we may not differ in the general principles though we may be of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars first sir though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion and it is very unhappy that it is so especially in the case before us as i shall shew afterwards yet there are some general principles in which we both agree viz first that there is a god and that this god having given us some stated general rules for our service and obedience we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him either by neglecting to do what he has commanded or by doing what he has expressly forbidden and let our different religions be what they will this general principle is readily owned by us all that the blessing of god does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous sinning against his command and every good christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are under his care living in a total neglect of god and his commands it is not your men being protestants whatever my opinion may be of such that discharges me from being concerned for their souls and from endeavouring if it lies before me that they should live in as little distance from and enmity with their maker as possible especially if you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit i could not yet imagine what he aimed at and told him i granted all he had said and thanked him that he would so far concern himself for us and begged he would explain the particulars of what he had observed that like joshua to take his own parable i might put away the accursed thing from us why then sir says he i will take the liberty you give me and there are three things which if i am right must stand in the way of god s blessing upon your endeavours here and which i should rejoice for your sake and their own to see removed and sir says he i promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all as soon as i name them especially because i shall convince you that every one of them may with great ease and very much to your satisfaction be remedied he gave me no leave to put in any more civilities but went on first sir says he you have here four englishmen who have fetched women from among the savages and have taken them as their wives and have had many children by them all and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner as the laws of god and man require and therefore are yet in the sense of both no less than adulterers and living in adultery to this sir says he i know you will object that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind or of any profession to perform the ceremony nor any pen and ink or paper to write down a contract of marriage and have it signed between them and i know also sir what the spaniard governor has told you i mean of the agreement that he obliged them to make when they took these women viz that they should choose them out by consent and keep separately to them which by the way is nothing of a marriage no agreement with the women as wives but only an agreement among themselves to keep them from quarrelling but sir the essence of the sacrament of matrimony so he called it being a roman consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man and wife but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the contract to compel the man and woman at all times to own and acknowledge each other obliging the man to abstain from all other women to engage in no other contract while these subsist and on all occasions as ability allows to provide honestly for them and their children and to oblige the women to the same on like conditions mutatis mutandis on their side now sir says he these men may when they please or when occasion presents abandon these women disown their children leave them to perish and take other women and marry them whilst these are living and here he added with some warmth how sir is god honoured in this unlawful liberty and how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place however good in themselves and however sincere in your design while these men who at present are your subjects under your absolute government and dominion are allowed by you to live in open adultery i confess i was struck at the thing itself but much more with the convincing arguments he supported it with for it was certainly true that though they had no clergyman on the spot yet a formal contract on both sides made before witnesses and confirmed by any token which they had all agreed to be bound by though it had been but the breaking a stick between them engaging the men to own these women for their wives upon all occasions and never to abandon them or their children and the women to the same with their husbands had been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of god and it was a great neglect that it was not done but i thought to have gotten off with my young priest by telling him that all that part was done when i was not here and they had lived so many years with them now that if it was adultery it was past remedy they could do nothing in it now sir says he asking your pardon for such freedom you are right in this that it being done in your absence you could not be charged with that part of the crime but i beseech you matter not yourself that you are not therefore under an obligation to do your uttermost now to put an end to it how can you think but that let the time past lie on whom it will all the guilt for the future will lie entirely upon you because it is certainly in your power now to put an end to it and in nobody s power but yours i was so dull still that i did not take him right but i imagined that by putting an end to it he meant that i should part them and not suffer them to live together any longer and i said to him i could not do that by any means for that it would put the whole island in confusion he seemed surprised that i should so far mistake him no sir says he i do not mean that you should separate them but legally and effectually marry them now and sir as my way of marrying may not be so easy to reconcile them to though it will be as effectual even by your own laws so your way may be as well before god and as valid among men i mean by a written contract signed by both man and woman and by all the witnesses present which all the laws of europe would decree to be valid i was amazed to see so much true piety and so much sincerity of zeal besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own party or church and such a true warmth for the preserving people that he had no knowledge of or relation to i say for preserving them from transgressing the laws of god the like of which i had indeed not met with any where but recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a written contract which i knew would stand too i returned it back upon him and told him i granted all that he had said to be just and on his part very kind that i would discourse with the men upon the point now when i came to them and i knew no reason why they should scruple to let him marry them all which i knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in england as if they were married by one of our own clergymen what was afterwards done in this matter i shall speak of by itself i then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he had to make acknowledging i was very much his debtor for the first and thanked him heartily for it he told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the second and hoped i would take it as well and this was that notwithstanding these english subjects of mine as he called them had lived with these women for almost seven years and had taught them to speak english and even to read it and that they were as he perceived women of tolerable understanding and capable of instruction yet they had not to this hour taught them any thing of the christian religion no not so much as to know that there was a god or a worship or in what manner god was to be served or that their own idolatry and worshipping they knew not who was false and absurd this he said was an unaccountable neglect and what god would certainly call them to an account for and perhaps at last take the work out of their hands he spoke this very affectionately and warmly i am persuaded says he had those men lived in the savage country whence their wives came the savages would have taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters and to worship the devil than any of these men so far as i can see has taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true god now sir said he though i do not acknowledge your religion or you mine yet we should be all glad to see the devil s servants and the subjects of his kingdom taught to know the general principles of the christian religion that they might at least hear of god and of a redeemer and of the resurrection and of a future state things which we all believe they had at least been so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true church than they are now in the public profession of idolatry and devil worship i could hold no longer i took him in my arms and embraced him with an excess of passion how far said i to him have i been from understanding the most essential part of a christian viz to love the interest of the christian church and the good of other men s souls i scarce have known what belongs to being a christian o sir do not say so replied he this thing is not your fault no said i but why did i never lay it to heart as well as you it is not too late yet said he be not too forward to condemn yourself but what can be done now said i you see i am going away will you give me leave said he to talk with these poor men about it yes with all my heart said i and i will oblige them to give heed to what you say too as to that said he we must leave them to the mercy of christ but it is our business to assist them encourage them and instruct them and if you will give me leave and god his blessing i do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home into the great circle of christianity if not into the particular faith that we all embrace and that even while you stay here upon this i said i shall not only give you leave but give you a thousand thanks for it what followed on this account i shall mention also again in its place i now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame why really says he it is of the same nature and i will proceed asking your leave with the same plainness as before it is about your poor savages yonder who are as i may say your conquered subjects it is a maxim sir that is or ought to be received among all christians of what church or pretended church soever viz that christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means and on all possible occasions it is on this principle that our church sends missionaries into persia india and china and that our clergy even of the superior sort willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages and the most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians to teach them the knowledge of the true god and to bring them over to embrace the christian faith now sir you have an opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of god their maker and redeemer that i wonder how you can pass by such an occasion of doing good which is really worth the expense of a man s whole life i was now struck dumb indeed and had not one word to say i had here a spirit of true christian zeal for god and religion before me let his particular principles be of what kind soever as for me i had not so much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before and i believe should not have thought of it for i looked upon these savages as slaves and people whom had we any work for them to do we would have used as such or would have been glad to have transported them to any other part of the world for our business was to get rid of them and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country so they had never seen their own but to the case i say i was confounded at his discourse and knew not what answer to make him he looked earnestly at me seeing me in some disorder sir said he i shall be very sorry if what i have said gives you any offence no no said i i am offended with nobody but myself but i am perfectly confounded not only to think that i should never take any notice of this before but with reflecting what notice i am able to take of it now you know sir said i what circumstances i am in i am bound to the east indies in a ship freighted by merchants and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here the men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon the owners account it is true i agreed to be allowed twelve days here and if i stay more i must pay 32 sterling per diem demurrage nor can i stay upon demurrage above eight days more and i have been here thirteen days already so that i am perfectly unable to engage in this work unless i would suffer myself to be left behind here again in which case if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage i should be just in the same condition that i was left in here at first and from which i have been so wonderfully delivered he owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage but laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty souls was not worth my venturing all i had in the world for i was not so sensible of that as he was and i returned upon him thus why sir it is a valuable thing indeed to be an instrument in god s hand to convert seven and thirty heathens to the knowledge of christ but as you are an ecclesiastic and are given over to that work so that it seems naturally to fall into the way of your profession how is it then that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it than press me to it upon this he faced about just before me as he walked along and pulling me to a full stop made me a very low bow i most heartily thank god and you sir says he for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work and if you think yourself discharged from it and desire me to undertake it i will most readily do it and think it a happy reward for all of the hazards and difficulties of such a broken disappointed voyage as i have met with that i have dropped at last into so glorious a work i discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to me his eyes sparkled like fire his face bowed and his colour came and went as if he had been falling into fits in a word he was tired with the agony of being embarked in such a work i paused a considerable while before i could tell what to say to him for i was really surprised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men not of his profession only but even of any profession whatsoever but after i had considered it awhile i asked him seriously if he was in earnest and that he would venture on the single consideration of an attempt on those poor people to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his life and at last might not know whether he should be able to do them any good or not he turned short upon me and asked me what i called a venture pray sir said he what do you think i consented to go in your ship to the east indies for nay said i that i know not unless it was to preach to the indians doubtless it was said he and do you think if i can convert these seven and thirty men to the faith of christ it is not worth my time though i should never be fetched off the island again nay is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than my life is or the life of twenty more of the same profession yes sir says he i would give christ and the blessed virgin thanks all my days if i could be made the least happy instrument of saving the souls of these poor men though i was never to set my foot off this island or see my native country any more but since you will honour me says he with putting me into this work for which i will pray for you all the days of my life i have one humble petition to you said he besides what is that said i why says he it is that you will leave your man friday with me to be my interpreter to them and to assist me for without some help i cannot speak to them or they to me i was sensibly troubled at his requesting friday because i could not think of parting with him and that for many reasons he had been the companion of my travels he was not only faithful to me but sincerely affectionate to the last degree and i had resolved to do something considerable for him if he out lived me as it was probable he would then i knew that as i had bred friday up to be a protestant it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another profession and he would never while his eyes were open believe that his old master was a heretic and would be damned and this might in the end ruin the poor fellow s principles and so turn him back again to his first idolatry however a sudden thought relieved me in this strait and it was this i told him i could not say that i was willing to part with friday on any account whatever though a work that to him was of more value than his life ought to me to be of much more value than the keeping or parting with a servant but on the other hand i was persuaded that friday would by no means consent to part with me and then to force him to it without his consent would be manifest injustice because i had promised i would never put him away and he had promised and engaged to me that he would never leave me unless i put him away he seemed very much concerned at it for he had no rational access to these poor people seeing he did not understand one word of their language nor they one word of his to remove this difficulty i told him friday s father had learnt spanish which i found he also understood and he should serve him for an interpreter so he was much better satisfied and nothing could persuade him but he would stay to endeavour to convert them but providence gave another and very happy turn to all this i come back now to the first part of his objections when we came to the englishmen i sent for them all together and after some accounts given them of what i had done for them viz what necessary things i had provided for them and how they were distributed which they were sensible of and very thankful for i began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had already taken of it and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was i first asked them if they were married men or bachelors they soon explained their condition to me and shewed me that two of them were widowers and the other three were single men or bachelors i asked them with what conscience they could take these women and lie with them as they had done call them their wives and have so many children by them and not be married lawfully to them they all gave me the answer that i expected viz that there was nobody to marry them that they agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives and to keep them and own them as their wives and they thought as things stood with them they were as legally married as if they had been married by a parson and with all the formalities in the world i told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of god and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives but that the laws of men being otherwise they might pretend they were not married and so desert the poor women and children hereafter and that their wives being poor desolate women friendless and moneyless would have no way to help themselves i therefore told them that unless i was assured of their honest intent i could do nothing for them but would take care that what i did should be for the women and children without them and that unless they would give some assurances that they would marry the women i could not think it was convenient they should continue together as man and wife for that it was both scandalous to men and offensive to god who they could not think would bless them if they went on thus all this passed as i expected and they told me especially will atkins who seemed now to speak for the rest that they loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own native country and would not leave them upon any account whatever and they did verily believe their wives were as virtuous and as modest and did to the utmost of their skill as much for them and for their children as any women could possibly do and they would not part with them on any account and will atkins for his own particular added if any man would take him away and offer to carry him home to england and to make him captain of the best man of war in the navy he would not go with him if he might not carry his wife and children with him and if there was a clergyman in the ship he would be married to her now with all his heart this was just as i would have it the priest was not with me at that moment but was not far off so to try him farther i told him i had a clergyman with me and if he was sincere i would have him married the next morning and bade him consider of it and talk with the rest he said as for himself he need not consider of it at all for he was very ready to do it and was glad i had a minister with me and he believed they would be all willing also i then told him that my friend the minister was a frenchman and could not speak english but that i would act the clerk between them he never so much as asked me whether he was a papist or protestant which was indeed what i was afraid of but i say they never inquired about it so we parted i went back to my clergyman and will atkins went in to talk with his companions i desired the french gentleman not to say any thing to them till the business was thorough ripe and i told him what answer the men had given me before i went from their quarter they all came to me and told me they had been considering what i had said that they were very glad to hear i had a clergyman in my company and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction i desired and to be formally married as soon as i pleased for they were far from desiring to part from their wives and that they meant nothing but what was very honest when they chose them so i appointed them to meet me the next morning and that in the mean time they should let their wives know the meaning of the marriage law and that it was not only to prevent any scandal but also to oblige them that they should not forsake them whatever might happen the women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing and were very well satisfied with it as indeed they had reason to be so they failed not to attend all together at my apartment next morning where i brought out my clergyman and though he had not on a minister s gown after the manner of england or the habit of a priest after the manner of france yet having a black vest something like a cassock with a sash round it he did not look very unlike a minister and as for his language i was interpreter but the seriousness of his behaviour to them and the scruple he made of marrying the women because they were not baptized and professed christians gave them an exceeding reverence for his person and there was no need after that to inquire whether he was a clergyman or no indeed i was afraid his scruple would have been carried so far as that he would not have married them at all nay notwithstanding all i was able to say to him he resisted me though modestly yet very steadily and at last refused absolutely to marry them unless he had first talked with the men and the women too and though at first i was a little backward to it yet at last i agreed to it with a good will perceiving the sincerity of his design when he came to them he let them know that i had acquainted him with their circumstances and with the present design that he was very willing to perform that part of his function and marry them as i had desired but that before he could do it he must take the liberty to talk with them he told them that in the sight of all different men and in the sense of the laws of society they had lived all this while in an open adultery and that it was true that nothing but the consenting to marry or effectually separating them from one another now could put an end to it but there was a difficulty in it too with respect to the laws of christian matrimony which he was not fully satisfied about viz that of marrying one that is a professed christian to a savage an idolater and a heathen one that is not baptized and yet that he did not see that there was time left for it to endeavour to persuade the women to be baptized or to profess the name of christ whom they had he doubted heard nothing of and without which they could not be baptized he told me he doubted they were but indifferent christians themselves that they had but little knowledge of god or his ways and therefore he could not expect that they had said much to their wives on that head yet but that unless they would promise him to use their endeavours with their wives to persuade them to become christians and would as well as they could instruct them in the knowledge and belief of god that made them and to worship jesus christ that redeemed them he could not marry them for he would have no hand in joining christians with savages nor was it consistent with the principles of the christian religion and was indeed expressly forbidden in god s law they heard all this very attentively and i delivered it very faithfully to them from his mouth as near his own words as i could only sometimes adding something of my own to convince them how just it was and how i was of his mind and i always very faithfully distinguished between what i said from myself and what were the clergyman s words they told me it was very true what the gentleman had said that they were but very indifferent christians themselves and that they had never talked to their wives about religion lord sir says will atkins how should we teach them religion why we know nothing ourselves and besides sir said he should we go to talk to them of god and jesus christ and heaven and hell it would be to make them laugh at us and ask us what we believe ourselves and if we should tell them we believe all the things that we speak of to them such as of good people going to heaven and wicked people to the devil they would ask us where we intended to go ourselves who believe all this and yet are such wicked fellows as we indeed are why sir said will tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion at that hearing folks must have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach other people will atkins said i to him though i am afraid what you say has too much truth in it yet can you not tell your wife that she is in the wrong that there is a god and a religion better than her own that her gods are idols that they can neither hear nor speak that there is a great being that made all things and that can destroy all that he has made that he rewards the good and punishes the bad that we are to be judged by him at last for all we do here you are not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you that all this is true and i am satisfied you know it all to be true and believe it yourself that s true sir said atkins but with what face can i say any thing to my wife of all this when she will tell me immediately it cannot be true not true said i what do you mean by that why sir said he she will tell me it cannot be true that this god i shall tell her of can be just or can punish or reward since i am not punished and sent to the devil that have been such a wicked creature as she knows i have been even to her and to every body else and that i should be suffered to live that have been always acting so contrary to what i must tell her is good and to what i ought to have done why truly atkins said i i am afraid thou speakest too much truth and with that i let the clergyman know what atkins had said for he was impatient to know o said the priest tell him there is one thing will make him the best minister in the world to his wife and that is repentance for none teach repentance like true penitents he wants nothing but to repent and then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct his wife he will then be able to tell her that there is not only a god and that he is the just rewarder of good and evil but that he is a merciful being and with infinite goodness and long suffering forbears to punish those that offend waiting to be gracious and willing not the death of a sinner but rather that he should return and live that he often suffers wicked men to go on a long time and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution that it is a clear evidence of god and of a future state that righteous men receive not their reward or wicked men their punishment till they come into another world and this will lend him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment let him but repent for himself he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife i repeated all this to atkins who looked very serious all the while and who we could easily perceive was more than ordinarily affected with it when being eager and hardly suffering me to make an end i know all this master says he and a great deal more but i han t the impudence to talk thus to my wife when god and my own conscience knows and my wife will be an undeniable evidence against me that i have lived as if i never heard of god or a future state or any thing about it and to talk of my repenting alas and with that he fetched a deep sigh and i could see that tears stood in his eyes tis past all that with me past it atkins said i what dost thou mean by that i know well enough what i mean sir says he i mean tis too late and that is too true i told my clergyman word for word what he said the poor zealous priest i must call him so for be his opinion what it will he had certainly a most singular affection for the good of other men s souls and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own i say this zealous affectionate man could not refrain tears also but recovering himself he said to me ask him but one question is he easy that it is too late or is he troubled and wishes it were not so i put the question fairly to atkins and he answered with a great deal of passion how could any man be easy in a condition that certainly must end in eternal destruction that he was far from being easy but that on the contrary he believed it would one time or the other ruin him what do you mean by that said i why he said he believed he should one time or another cut his own throat to put an end to the terror of it the clergyman shook his head with a great concern in his face when i told him all this but turning quick to me upon it said if that be his case you may assure him it is not too late christ will give him repentance but pray says he explain this to him that as no man is saved but by christ and the merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy does he think he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy pray tell him there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive and when god may refuse to hear but that tis never too late for men to ask mercy and we that are christ s servants are commanded to preach mercy at all times in the name of jesus christ to all those that sincerely repent so that tis never too late to repent i told atkins all this and he heard me with great earnestness but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest for he said to me he would go and have some talk with his wife so he went out awhile and we talked to the rest i perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion much as i was when i went rambling away from my father and yet that there were none of them backward to hear what had been said and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with their wives about it and do their endeavour to persuade them to turn christians the clergyman smiled upon me when i reported what answer they gave but said nothing a good while but at last shaking his head we that are christ s servants says he can go no farther than to exhort and instruct and when men comply submit to the reproof and promise what we ask tis all we can do we are bound to accept their good words but believe me sir said he whatever you may have known of the life of that man you call william atkins i believe he is the only sincere convert among them i take that man to be a true penitent i won t despair of the rest but that man is perfectly struck with the sense of his past life and i doubt not but when he comes to talk of religion to his wife he will talk himself effectually into it for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves i knew a man added he who having nothing but a summary notion of religion himself and being wicked and profligate to the last degree in his life made a thorough reformation in himself by labouring to convert a jew and if that poor atkins begins but once to talk seriously of jesus christ to his wife my life for it he talks himself into a thorough convert makes himself a penitent and who knows what may follow upon this discourse however and their promising as above to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace christianity he married the other three couple but will atkins and his wife were not yet come in after this my clergyman waiting awhile was curious to know where atkins was gone and turning to me says he i entreat you sir let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look i dare say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking seriously with his wife and teaching her already something of religion i began to be of the same mind so we went out together and i carried him a way which none knew but myself and where the trees were so thick set as that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves and far harder to see in than to see out when coming to the edge of the wood i saw atkins and his tawny savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush very eager in discourse i stopped short till my clergyman came up to me and then having shewed him where they were we stood and looked very steadily at them a good while we observed him very earnest with her pointing up to the sun and to every quarter of the heavens then down to the earth then out to the sea then to himself then to her to the woods to the trees now says my clergyman you see my words are made good the man preaches to her mark him now he is telling her that our god has made him and her and the heavens the earth the sea the woods the trees c i believe he is said i immediately we perceived will atkins start up upon his feet fall down upon his knees and lift up both his hands we supposed he said something but we could not hear him it was too far off for that he did not continue kneeling half a minute but comes and sits down again by his wife and talks to her again we perceived then the woman very attentive but whether she said any thing or no we could not tell while the poor fellow was upon his knees i could see the tears run plentifully down my clergyman s cheeks and i could hardly forbear myself but it was a great affliction to us both that we were not near enough to hear any thing that passed between them well however we could come no nearer for fear of disturbing them so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversation and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voice he sat down again as i have said close by her and talked again earnestly to her and two or three times we could see him embrace her passionately another time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes and then kiss her again with a kind of transport very unusual and after several of these things we saw him on a sudden jump up again and lend her his hand to help her up when immediately leading her by the hand a step or two they both kneeled down together and continued so about two minutes my friend could bear it no longer but cries out aloud st paul st paul behold he prayeth i was afraid atkins would hear him therefore i entreated him to withhold himself awhile that we might see an end of the scene which to me i must confess was the most affecting and yet the most agreeable that ever i saw in my life well he strove with himself and contained himself for awhile but was in such raptures of joy to think that the poor heathen woman was become a christian that he was not able to contain himself he wept several times then throwing up his hands and crossing his breast said over several things ejaculatory and by way of giving god thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our endeavours some he spoke softly and i could not well hear others audibly some in latin some in french then two or three times the tears of joy would interrupt him that he could not speak at all but i begged that he would compose himself and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was before us which he did for a time and the scene was not ended there yet for after the poor man and his wife were risen again from their knees we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her and we observed by her motion that she was greatly affected with what he said by her frequent lifting up her hands laying her hand to her breast and such other postures as usually express the greatest seriousness and attention this continued about half a quarter of an hour and then they walked away too so that we could see no more of them in that situation i took this interval to talk with my clergyman and first i told him i was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to that though i was hard enough of belief in such cases yet that i began to think it was all very sincere here both in the man and his wife however ignorant they both might be and i hoped such a beginning would have yet a more happy end and who knows said i but these two may in time by instruction and example work upon some of the others some of them said he turning quick upon me ay upon all of them depend upon it if those two savages for he has been but little better as you relate it should embrace jesus christ they will never leave till they work upon all the rest for true religion is naturally communicative and he that is once made a christian will never leave a pagan behind him if be can help it i owned it was a most christian principle to think so and a testimony of a true zeal as well as a generous heart in him but my friend said i will you give me liberty to start one difficulty here i cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate concern which you shew for the turning the poor people from their paganism to the christian religion but how does this comfort you while these people are in your account out of the pale of the catholic church without which you believe there is no salvation so that you esteem these but heretics still and for other reasons as effectually lost as the pagans themselves to this he answered with abundance of candour and christian charity thus sir i am a catholic of the roman church and a priest of the order of st benedict and i embrace all the principles of the roman faith but yet if you will believe me and this i do not speak in compliment to you or in respect to my circumstances and your civilities i say nevertheless i do not look upon you who call yourselves reformed without some charity i dare not say though i know it is our opinion in general yet i dare not say that you cannot be saved i will by no means limit the mercy of christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you into the bosom of his church in a manner to us imperceivable and which it is impossible for us to know and i hope you have the same charity for us i pray daily for your being all restored to christ s church by whatsoever methods he who is all wise is pleased to direct in the mean time sure you will allow it to consist with me as a roman to distinguish far between a protestant and a pagan between him that calls on jesus christ though in a way which i do not think is according to the true faith and a savage a barbarian that knows no god no christ no redeemer at all and if you are not within the pale of the catholic church we hope you are nearer being restored to it than those that know nothing at all of god or his church i rejoice therefore when i see this poor man who you say has been a profligate and almost a murderer kneel down and pray to jesus christ as we suppose he did though not fully enlightened believing that god from whom every such work proceeds will sensibly touch his heart and bring him to the further knowledge of the truth in his own time and if god shall influence this poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage his wife i can never believe that he shall be cast away himself and have i not reason then to rejoice the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of christ though they may not be brought quite home into the bosom of the catholic church just at the time when i may desire it leaving it to the goodness of christ to perfect his work in his own time and his own way certainly i would rejoice if all the savages in america were brought like this poor woman to pray to god though they were to be all protestants at first rather than they should continue pagans and heathens firmly believing that he who had bestowed that first light upon them would farther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace and bring them into the pale of his church when he should see good i was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this truly pious papist as much as i was oppressed by the power of his reasoning and it presently occurred to my thoughts that if such a temper was universal we might be all catholic christians whatever church or particular profession we were joined to or joined in that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right principles and in a word as he thought that the like charity would make us all catholics as i told him i believed had all the members of his church the like moderation they would soon be all protestants and there we left that part for we never disputed at all however i talked to him another way and taking him by the hand my friend said i i wish all the clergy of the roman church were blessed with such moderation and an equal share of your charity i am entirely of your opinion but i must tell you that if you should preach such doctrine in spain or italy they would put you into the inquisition it may be so said he i know not what they might do in spain and italy but i will not say they would be the better christians for that severity for i am sure there is no heresy in too much charity well as will atkins and his wife were gone our business there was over so we went back our own way and when we came back we found them waiting to be called in observing this i asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or no and it was his opinion we should not but that we should talk to him first and hear what he would say to us so we called him in alone nobody being in the place but ourselves and i began with him thus will atkins said i pr ythee what education had you what was your father w a a better man than ever i shall be sir my father was a clergyman r c what education did he give you w a he would have taught me well sir but i despised all education instruction or correction like a beast as i was r c it is true solomon says he that despiseth reproof is brutish w a ay sir i was brutish indeed i murdered my father for god s sake sir talk no more about that sir i murdered my poor father priest ha a murderer here the priest started for i interpreted every word as he spoke it and looked pale it seems he believed that will had really killed his own father r c no no sir i do not understand him so will atkins explain yourself you did not kill your father did you with your own hands w a no sir i did not cut his throat but i cut the thread of all his comforts and shortened his days i broke his heart by the most ungrateful unnatural return for the most tender affectionate treatment that ever father gave or child could receive r c well i did not ask you about your father to extort this confession i pray god give you repentance for it and forgive you that and all your other sins but i asked you because i see that though you have not much learning yet you are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good that you have known more of religion a great deal than you have practised w a though you sir did not extort the confession that i make about my father conscience does and whenever we come to look back upon our lives the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly the first that touch us the wounds they make lie deepest and the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind of all the sins we can commit r c you talk too feelingly and sensible for me atkins i cannot bear it w a you bear it master i dare say you know nothing of it r c yes atkins every shore every hill nay i may say every tree in this island is witness to the anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and base usage of a good tender father a father much like yours by your description and i murdered my father as well as you will atkins but think for all that my repentance is short of yours too by a great deal i would have said more if i could have restrained my passions but i thought this poor man s repentance was so much sincerer than mine that i was going to leave off the discourse and retire for i was surprised with what he said and thought that instead of my going about to teach and instruct him the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most surprising and unexpected manner i laid all this before the young clergyman who was greatly affected with it and said to me did i not say sir that when this man was converted he would preach to us all i tell you sir if this one man be made a true penitent here will be no need of me he will make christians of all in the island but having a little composed myself i renewed my discourse with will atkins but will said i how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now w a sir you have set me about a work that has struck a dart through my very soul i have been talking about god and religion to my wife in order as you directed me to make a christian of her and she has preached such a sermon to me as i shall never forget while i live r c no no it is not your wife has preached to you but when you were moving religious arguments to her conscience has flung them back upon you w a ay sir with such a force as is not to be resisted r c pray will let us know what passed between you and your wife for i know something of it already w a sir it is impossible to give you a full account of it i am too full to hold it and yet have no tongue to express it but let her have said what she will and though i cannot give you an account of it this i can tell you of it that i resolve to amend and reform my life r c but tell us some of it how did you begin will for this has been an extraordinary case that is certain she has preached a sermon indeed if she has wrought this upon you w a why i first told her the nature of our laws about marriage and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in the power of one or other to break that otherwise order and justice could not be maintained and men would run from their wives and abandon their children mix confusedly with one another and neither families be kept entire or inheritances be settled by a legal descent r c you talk like a civilian will could you make her understand what you meant by inheritance and families they know no such thing among the savages but marry any how without any regard to relation consanguinity or family brother and sister nay as i have been told even the father and daughter and the son and the mother w a i believe sir you are misinformed my wife assures me of the contrary and that they abhor it perhaps for any further relations they may not be so exact as we are but she tells me they never touch one another in the near relations you speak of r c well what did she say to what you told her w a she said she liked it very well and it was much better than in her country r c but did you tell her what marriage was w a ay ay there began all our dialogue i asked her if she would be married to me our way she asked me what way that was i told her marriage was appointed of god and here we had a strange talk together indeed as ever man and wife had i believe n b this dialogue between w atkins and his wife as i took it down in writing just after he told it me was as follows wife appointed by your god why have you a god in your country w a yes my dear god is in every country wife no your god in my country my country have the great old benamnekee god w a child i am very unfit to shew you who god is god is in heaven and made the heaven and the earth the sea and all that in them is wife no makee de earth no you god makee de earth no make my country w a laughed a little at her expression of god not making her country w a no laugh why laugh me this no ting to laugh he was justly reproved by his wife for she was more serious than he at first w a that s true indeed i will not laugh any more my dear wife why you say you god make all w a yes child our god made the whole world and you and me and all things for he is the only true god there is no god but he he lives for ever in heaven wife why you no tell me long ago w a that s true indeed but i have been a wicked wretch and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with any thing before but have lived without god in the world myself wife what have you de great god in your country you no know him no say o to him no do good ting for him that no impossible w a it is too true though for all that we live as if there was no god in heaven or that he had no power on earth wife but why god let you do so why he no makee you good live w a it is all our own fault wife but you say me he is great much great have much great power can make kill when he will why he no make kill when you no serve him no say o to him no be good mans w a that is true he might strike me dead and i ought to expect it for i have been a wicked wretch that is true but god is merciful and does not deal with us as we deserve wife but then do not you tell god tankee for that too w a no indeed i have not thanked god for his mercy any more than i have feared god for his power wife then you god no god me no tink believe he be such one great much power strong no makee kill you though you makee him much angry w a what will my wicked life hinder you from believing in god what a dreadful creature am i and what a sad truth is it that the horrid lives of christians hinder the conversion of heathens wife now me tink you have great much god up there she points up to heaven and yet no do well no do good ting can he tell sure he no tell what you do w a yes yes he knows and seen all things he hears us speak sees what we do knows what we think though we do not speak wife what he no hear you swear curse speak the great damn w a yes yes he hears it all wife where be then the muchee great power strong w a he is merciful that is all we can say for it and this proves him to be the true god he is god and not man and therefore we are not consumed here will atkins told us he was struck with horror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly that god sees and hears and knows the secret thoughts of the heart and all that we do and yet that he had dared to do all the vile things he had done wife merciful what you call dat w a he is our father and maker and he pities and spares us wife so then he never makee kill never angry when you do wicked then he no good himself or no great able w a yes yes my dear he is infinitely good and infinitely great and able to punish too and some times to shew his justice and vengeance he lets fly his anger to destroy sinners and make examples many are cut off in their sins wife but no makee kill you yet then he tell you may be that he no makee you kill so you make de bargain with him you do bad ting he no be angry at you when he be angry at other mans w a no indeed my sins are all presumptions upon his goodness and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me as he has done other men wife well and yet no kill no makee you dead what you say to him for that you no tell him tankee for all that too w a i am an unthankful ungrateful dog that is true wife why he no makee you much good better you say he makee you w a he made me as he made all the world tis i have deformed myself and abused his goodness and have made myself an abominable wretch wife i wish you makee god know me i no makee him angry i no do bad wicked ting here will atkins said his heart sunk within him to hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know god and he such a wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her about god but what the reproach of his own carriage would make most irrational to her to believe nay that already she could not believe in god because he that was so wicked was not destroyed w a my dear you mean you wish i could teach you to know god not god to know you for he knows you already and every thought in your heart wife why then he know what i say to you now he know me wish to know him how shall me know who makee me w a poor creature he must teach thee i cannot teach thee i ll pray to him to teach thee to know him and to forgive me that i am unworthy to teach thee the poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make her know god and her wishing to know him that he said he fell down on his knees before her and prayed to god to enlighten her mind with the saving knowledge of jesus christ and to pardon his sins and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of religion after which he sat down by her again and their dialogue went on n b this was the time when we saw him kneel down and lift up his hands wife what you put down the knee for what you hold up the hand for what you say who you speak to what is that w a my dear i bow my knees in token of my submission to him that made me i said o to him as you call it and as you say your old men do to their idol benamuckee that is i prayed to him wife what you say o to him for w a i prayed to him to open your eyes and your understanding that you may know him and be accepted by him wife can he do that too w a yes he can he can do all things wife but he no hear what you say w a yes he has bid us pray to him and promised to hear us wife bid you pray when he bid you how he bid you what you hear him speak w a no we do not hear him speak but he has revealed himself many ways to us here he was at a great loss to make her understand that god had revealed himself to us by his word and what his word was but at last he told it her thus w a god has spoken to some good men in former days even from heaven by plain words and god has inspired good men by his spirit and they have written all his laws down in a book wife me no understand that where is book w a alas my poor creature i have not this book but i hope i shall one time or other get it for you to read it here he embraced her with great affection but with inexpressible grief that he had not a bible wife but how you makee me know that god teachee them to write that book w a by the same rule that we know him to be god wife what rule what way you know w a because he teaches and commands nothing but what is good righteous and holy and tends to make us perfectly good as well as perfectly happy and because he forbids and commands us to avoid all that is wicked that is evil in itself or evil in its consequences wife that me would understand that me fain see if he reward all good thing punish all wicked thing he teachee all good thing forbid all wicked thing he makee all thing he give all thing he hear me when i say o to him as you go to do just now he makee me good if i wish be good he spare me no makee kill me when i no be good all this you say he do yes he be great god me take think believe him be great god me say o to him too with you my dear here the poor man said he could forbear no longer but raising her up made her kneel by him and he prayed to god aloud to instruct her in the knowledge of himself by his spirit and that by some good providence if possible she might some time or other come to have a bible that she might read the word of god and be taught by him to know him this was the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand and saw him kneel down by her as above they had several other discourses it seems after this too long to set down here and particularly she made him promise that since he confessed his own life had been a wicked abominable course of provocation against god he would reform it and not make god angry any more lest he should make him dead as she called it and then she should be left alone and never be taught to know this god better and lest he should be miserable as he told her wicked men should be after death this was a strange account and very affecting to us both but particularly the young clergyman he was indeed wonderfully surprised with it but under the greatest affliction imaginable that he could not talk to her that he could not speak english to make her understand him and as she spoke but very broken english he could not understand her however he turned himself to me and told me that he believed there must be more to do with this woman than to marry her i did not understand him at first but at length he explained himself viz that she ought to be baptized i agreed with him in that part readily and was for going about it presently no no hold sir said he though i would have her baptized by all means yet i must observe that will atkins her husband has indeed brought her in a wonderful manner to be willing to embrace a religious life and has given her just ideas of the being of a god of his power justice and mercy yet i desire to know of him if he has said any thing to her of jesus christ and of the salvation of sinners of the nature of faith in him and the redemption by him of the holy spirit the resurrection the last judgment and a future state i called will atkins again and asked him but the poor fellow fell immediately into tears and told us he had said something to her of all those things but that he was himself so wicked a creature and his own conscience so reproached him with his horrid ungodly life that he trembled at the apprehensions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give to those things and make her rather contemn religion than receive it but he was assured he said that her mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those things that if i would but discourse with her she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not be lost upon her accordingly i called her in and placing myself as interpreter between my religious priest and the woman i entreated him to begin with her but sure such a sermon was never preached by a popish priest in these latter ages of the world and as i told him i thought he had all the zeal all the knowledge all the sincerity of a christian without the errors of a roman catholic and that i took him to be such a clergyman as the roman bishops were before the church of rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men in a word he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of christ and of redemption by him not with wonder and astonishment only as she did the first notions of a god but with joy and faith with an affection and a surprising degree of understanding scarce to be imagined much less to be expressed and at her own request she was baptized when he was preparing to baptize her i entreated him that he would perform that office with some caution that the man might not perceive he was of the roman church if possible because of other ill consequences which might attend a difference among us in that very religion which we were instructing the other in he told me that as he had no consecrated chapel nor proper things for the office i should see he would do it in a manner that i should not know by it that he was a roman catholic himself it i had not known it before and so he did for saying only some words over to himself in latin which i could not understand he poured a whole dishfull of water upon the woman s head pronouncing in french very loud mary which was the name her husband desired me to give her for i was her godfather i baptize thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost so that none could know any thing by it what religion he was of he gave the benediction afterwards in latin but either will atkins did not know but it was in french or else did not take notice of it at that time as soon as this was over he married them and after the marriage was over he turned himself to will atkins and in a very affectionate manner exhorted him not only to persevere in that good disposition he was in but to support the convictions that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life told him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes represented to him how god had honoured him with being the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the christian religion and that he should be careful he did not dishonour the grace of god and that if he did he would see the heathen a better christian than himself the savage converted and the instrument cast away he said a great many good things to them both and then recommended them in a few words to god s goodness gave them the benediction again i repeating every thing to them in english and thus ended the ceremony i think it was the most pleasant agreeable day to me that ever i passed in my whole life but my clergyman had not done yet his thoughts hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty seven savages and fain he would have staid upon the island to have undertaken it but i convinced him first that his undertaking was impracticable in itself and secondly that perhaps i could put it into a way of being done in his absence to his satisfaction of which by and by having thus brought the affair of the island to a narrow compass i was preparing to go on board the ship when the young man whom i had taken out of the famished ship s company came to me and told me he understood i had a clergyman with me and that i had caused the englishmen to be married to the savages whom they called wives that he had a match too which he desired might be finished before i went between two christians which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me i knew this must be the young woman who was his mother s servant for there was no other christian woman on the island so i began to persuade him not to do any thing of that kind rashly or because he found himself in this solitary circumstance i represented that he had some considerable substance in the world and good friends as i understood by himself and by his maid also that the maid was not only poor and a servant but was unequal to him she being twenty six or twenty seven years old and he not above seventeen or eighteen that he might very probably with my assistance make a remove from this wilderness and come into his own country again and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent his choice and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantageous to both i was going to say more but he interrupted me smiling and told me with a great deal of modesty that i mistook in my guesses that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts his present circumstances being melancholy and disconsolate enough and he was very glad to hear that i had some thoughts of putting them in a way to see their own country again and that nothing should have set him upon staying there but that the voyage i was going was so exceeding long and hazardous and would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends that he had nothing to desire of me but that i would settle him in some little property of the island where he was give him a servant or two and some few necessaries and he would settle himself here like a planter waiting the good time when if ever i returned to england i would redeem him and hoped i would not be unmindful of him when i came to england that he would give me some letters to his friends in london to let them know how good i had been to him and what part of the world and what circumstances i had left him in and he promised me that whenever i redeemed him the plantation and all the improvements he had made upon it let the value be what it would should be wholly mine his discourse was very prettily delivered considering his youth and was the more agreeable to me because he told me positively the match was not for himself i gave him all possible assurances that if i lived to come safe to england i would deliver his letters and do his business effectually and that he might depend i would never forget the circumstances i left him in but still i was impatient to know who was the person to be married upon which he told me it was my jack of all trades and his maid susan i was most agreeably surprised when he named the match for indeed i had thought it very suitable the character of that man i have given already and as for the maid she was a very honest modest sober and religious young woman had a very good share of sense was agreeable enough in her person spoke very handsomely and to the purpose always with decency and good manners and not backward to speak when any thing required it or impertinently forward to speak when it was not her business very handy and housewifely in any thing that was before her an excellent manager and fit indeed to have been governess to the whole island she knew very well how to behave herself to all kind of folks she had about her and to better if she had found any there the match being proposed in this manner we married them the same day and as i was father at the altar as i may say and gave her away so i gave her a portion for i appointed her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for their plantation and indeed this match and the proposal the young gentleman made to me to give him a small property in the island put me upon parcelling it out among them that they might not quarrel afterwards about their situation this sharing out the land to them i left to will atkins who indeed was now grown a most sober grave managing fellow perfectly reformed exceeding pious and religious and as far as i may be allowed to speak positively in such a case i verily believe was a true sincere penitent he divided things so justly and so much to every one s satisfaction that they only desired one general writing under my hand for the whole which i caused to be drawn up and signed and sealed to them setting out the bounds and situation of every man s plantation and testifying that i gave them thereby severally a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective plantations or farms with their improvements to them and their heirs reserving all the rest of the island as my own property and a certain rent for every particular plantation after eleven years if i or any one from me or in my name came to demand it producing an attested copy of the same writing as to the government and laws among them i told them i was not capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give themselves only made them promise me to live in love and good neighbourhood with one another and so i prepared to leave them one thing i must not omit and that is that being now settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves and having much business in hand it was but odd to have seven and thirty indians live in a nook of the island independent and indeed unemployed for excepting the providing themselves food which they had difficulty enough in doing sometimes they had no manner of business or property to manage i proposed therefore to the governor spaniard that he should go to them with friday s father and propose to them to remove and either plant for themselves or take them into their several families as servants to be maintained for their labour but without being absolute slaves for i would not admit them to make them slaves by force by any means because they had their liberty given by capitulation and as it were articles of surrender which they ought not to break they most willingly embraced the proposal and came all very cheerfully along with him so we allotted them land and plantations which three or four accepted of but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the several families we had settled and thus my colony was in a manner settled as follows the spaniards possessed my original habitation which was the capital city and extended their plantation all along the side of the brook which made the creek that i have so often described as far as my bower and as they increased their culture it went always eastward the english lived in the north east part where will atkins and his comrades began and came on southward and south west towards the back part of the spaniards and every plantation had a great addition of land to take in if they found occasion so that they need not jostle one another for want of room all the west end of the island was left uninhabited that if any of the savages should come on shore there only for their usual customary barbarities they might come and go if they disturbed nobody nobody would disturb them and no doubt but they were often ashore and went away again for i never heard that the planters were ever attacked and disturbed any more it now came into my thoughts that i had hinted to my friend the clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction and i told him that now i thought it was put in a fair way for the savages being thus divided among the christians if they would but every one of them do their part with those which came under their hands i hoped it might have a very good effect he agreed presently in that if said he they will do their part but how says he shall we obtain that of them i told him we would call them all together and leave it in charge with them or go to them one by one which he thought best so we divided it he to speak to the spaniards who were all papists and i to the english who were all protestants and we recommended it earnestly to them and made them promise that they would never make any distinction of papist or protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn christians but teach them the general knowledge of the true god and of their saviour jesus christ and they likewise promised us that they would never have any differences or disputes one with another about religion when i came to will atkins s house i may call it so for such a house or such a piece of basket work i believe was not standing in the world again i say when i came thither i found the young woman i have mentioned above and william atkins s wife were become intimates and this prudent and religious young woman had perfected the work will atkins had begun and though it was not above four days after what i have related yet the new baptized savage woman was made such a christian as i have seldom heard of any like her in all my observation or conversation in the world it came next into my mind in the morning before i went to them that among all the needful things i had to leave with them i had not left a bible in which i shewed myself less considering for them than my good friend the widow was for me when she sent me the cargo of 100 l from lisbon where she packed up three bibles and a prayer book however the good woman s charity had a greater extent than ever she imagined for they were reserved for the comfort and instruction of those that made much better use of them than i had done i took one of the bibles in my pocket and when i came to william atkins s tent or house i found the young woman and atkins s baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together for william atkins told it me with a great deal of joy i asked if they were together now and he said yes so i went into the house and he with me and we found them together very earnest in discourse o sir says william atkins when god has sinners to reconcile to himself and aliens to bring home he never wants a messenger my wife has got a new instructor i knew i was unworthy as i was incapable of that work that young woman has been sent hither from heaven she is enough to convert a whole island of savages the young woman blushed and rose up to go away but i desired her to sit still i told her she had a good work upon her hands and i hoped god would bless her in it we talked a little and i did not perceive they had any book among them though i did not ask but i put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my bible here said i to atkins i have brought you an assistant that perhaps you had not before the man was so confounded that he was not able to speak for some time but recovering himself he takes it with both hands and turning to his wife here my dear says he did not i tell you our god though he lives above could hear what we said here is the book i prayed for when you and i kneeled down under the bush now god has heard us and sent it when he had said thus the man fell in such transports of a passionate joy that between the joy of having it and giving god thanks for it the tears ran down his face like a child that was crying the woman was surprised and was like to have run into a mistake that none of us were aware of for she firmly believed god had sent the book upon her husband s petition it is true that providentially it was so and might be taken so in a consequent sense but i believed it would have been no difficult matter at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book but it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take place so i turned to the young woman and told her we did not desire to impose upon the convert in her first and more ignorant understanding of things and begged her to explain to her that god may be very properly said to answer our petitions when in the course of his providence such things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned for but we do not expect returns from heaven in a miraculous and particular manner and that it is our mercy it is not so this the young woman did afterwards effectually so that there was i assure you no priestcraft used here and i should have thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so but the surprise of joy upon will atkins is really not to be expressed and there we may be sure was no delusion sure no man was ever more thankful in the world for any thing of its kind than he was for this bible and i believe never any man was glad of a bible from a better principle and though he had been a most profligate creature desperate headstrong outrageous furious and wicked to a great degree yet this man is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing children viz that parents should never give over to teach and instruct or ever despair of the success of their endeavours let the children be ever so obstinate refractory or to appearance insensible of instruction for if ever god in his providence touches the consciences of such the force of their education returns upon them and the early instruction of parents is not lost though it may have been many years laid asleep but some time or other they may find the benefit of it thus it was with this poor man however ignorant he was or divested of religion and christian knowledge he found he had some to do with now more ignorant than himself and that the least part of the instruction of his good father that could now come to his mind was of use to him among the rest it occurred to him he said how his father used to insist much upon the inexpressible value of the bible the privilege and blessing of it to nations families and persons but he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till now when being to talk to heathens savages and barbarians he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance the young woman was very glad of it also for the present occasion though she had one and so had the youth on board our ship among the goods which were not yet brought on shore and now having said so many things of this young woman i cannot omit telling one story more of her and myself which has something in it very informing and remarkable i have related to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced how her mistress was starved to death and did die on board that unhappy ship we met at sea and how the whole ship s company being reduced to the last extremity the gentlewoman and her son and this maid were first hardly used as to provisions and at last totally neglected and starved that is to say brought to the last extremity of hunger one day being discoursing with her upon the extremities they suffered i asked her if she could describe by what she felt what it was to starve and how it appeared she told me she believed she could and she told her tale very distinctly thus first sir said she we had for some days fared exceeding hard and suffered very great hunger but now at last we were wholly without food of any kind except sugar and a little wine and a little water the first day after i had received no food at all i found myself towards evening first empty and sickish at my stomach and nearer night mightily inclined to yawning and sleepy i lay down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep and slept about three hours and awaked a little refreshed having taken a glass of wine when i lay down after being about three hours awake it being about five o clock in the morning i found myself empty and my stomach sickish again and lay down again but could not sleep at all being very faint and ill and thus i continued all the second day with a strange variety first hungry then sick again with retchings to vomit the second night being obliged to go to bed again without any food more than a draught of fair water and being asleep i dreamed i was at barbadoes and that the market was mightily stocked with provisions that i bought some for my mistress and went and dined very heartily i thought my stomach was full after this as it would have been after or at a good dinner but when i waked i was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the extremity of famine the last glass of wine we had i drank and put sugar into it because of its having some spirit to supply nourishment but there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting office to work upon i found the only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head and i lay as they told me stupid and senseless as one drunk for some time the third day in the morning after a night of strange and confused inconsistent dreams and rather dozing than sleeping i awaked ravenous and furious with hunger and i question had not my understanding returned and conquered it i say i question whether if i had been a mother and had had a little child with me its life would have been safe or no this lasted about three hours during which time i was twice raging mad as any creature in bedlam as my young master told me and as he can now inform you in one of these fits of lunacy or distraction whether by the motion of the ship or some slip of my foot i know not i fell down and struck my face against the corner of a pallet bed in which my mistress lay and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose and the cabin boy bringing me a little basin i sat down and bled into it a great deal and as the blood ran from me i came to myself and the violence of the flame or the fever i was in abated and so did the ravenous part of the hunger then i grew sick and retched to vomit but could not for i had nothing in my stomach to bring up after i had bled some time i swooned and they all believed i was dead but i came to myself soon after and then had a most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described not like the colic but a gnawing eager pain for food and towards night it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food something like as i suppose the longing of a woman with child i took another draught of water with sugar in it but my stomach loathed the sugar and brought it all up again then i took a draught of water without sugar and that stayed with me and i laid me down upon the bed praying most heartily that it would please god to take me away and composing my mind in hopes of it i slumbered awhile and then waking thought myself dying being light with vapours from an empty stomach i recommended my soul to god and earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into the sea all this while my mistress lay by me just as i thought expiring but bore it with much more patience than i and gave the last bit of bread she had to her child my young master who would not have taken it but she obliged him to eat it and i believe it saved his life towards the morning i slept again and first when i awaked i fell into a violent passion of crying and after that had a second fit of violent hunger so that i got up ravenous and in a most dreadful condition had my mistress been dead so much as i loved her i am certain i should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as much relish and as unconcerned as ever i did the flesh of any creature appointed for food and once or twice i was going to bite my own arm at last i saw the basin in which was the blood had bled at my nose the day before i ran to it and swallowed it with such haste and such a greedy appetite as if i had wondered nobody had taken it before and afraid it should be taken from me now though after it was down the thoughts of it filled me with horror yet it checked the fit of hunger and i drank a draught of fair water and was composed and refreshed for some hours after it this was the fourth day and thus i held it till towards night when within the compass of three hours i had all these several circumstances over again one after another viz sick sleepy eagerly hungry pain in the stomach then ravenous again then sick again then lunatic then crying then ravenous again and so every quarter of an hour and my strength wasted exceedingly at night i laid me down having no comfort but in the hope that i should die before morning all this night i had no sleep but the hunger was now turned into a disease and i had a terrible colic and griping wind instead of food having found its way into my bowels and in this condition i lay till morning when i was surprised a little with the cries and lamentations of my young master who called out to me that his mother was dead i lifted myself up a little for i had not strength to rise but found she was not dead though she was able to give very little signs of life i had then such convulsions in my stomach for want of some sustenance that i cannot describe them with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite that nothing but the tortures of death can imitate and this condition i was in when i heard the seamen above cry out a sail a sail and halloo and jump about as if they were distracted i was not able to get off from the bed and my mistress much less and my master was so sick that i thought he had been expiring so we could not open the cabin door or get any account what it was that occasioned such a combustion nor had we any conversation with the ship s company for two days they having told us they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in the ship and they told us afterwards they thought we had been dead it was this dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save our lives and how you found us sir you know as well as i and better too this was her own relation and is such a distinct account of starving to death as i confess i never met with and was exceeding entertaining to me i am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account because the youth gave me an account of a good part of it though i must own not so distinct and so feelingly as his maid and the rather because it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own life but the poor maid though her constitution being stronger than that of her mistress who was in years and a weakly woman too she might struggle harder with it i say the poor maid might be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress who might be allowed to keep the last bits something longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid no question as the case is here related if our ship or some other had not so providentially met them a few days more would have ended all their lives unless they had prevented it by eating one another and even that as their case stood would have served them but a little while they being five hundred leagues from any land or any possibility of relief other than in the miraculous manner it happened but this is by the way i return to my disposition of things among the people and first it is to be observed here that for many reasons i did not think fit to let them know any thing of the sloop i had framed and which i thought of setting up among them for i found at least at my first coming such seeds of division among them that i saw it plainly had i set up the sloop and left it among them they would upon very light disgust have separated and gone away from one another or perhaps have turned pirates and so made the island a den of thieves instead of a plantation of sober and religious people as i intended it to be nor did i leave the two pieces of brass cannon that i had on board or the two quarter deck guns that my nephew took extraordinary for the same reason i thought they had enough to qualify them for a defensive war against any that should invade them but i was not to set them up for an offensive war or to encourage them to go abroad to attack others which in the end would only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and all their undertakings i reserved the sloop therefore and the guns for their service another way as i shall observe in its place i have now done with the island i left them all in good circumstances and in a flourishing condition and went on board my ship again the fifth day of may having been five and twenty days among them and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till i came to remove them i promised to send some further relief from the brasils if i could possibly find an opportunity and particularly i promised to send them some cattle such as sheep hogs and cows for as to the two cows and calves which i brought from england we had been obliged by the length of our voyage to kill them at sea for want of hay to feed them the next day giving them a salute of five guns at parting we set sail and arrived at the bay of all saints in the brasils in about twenty two days meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this that about three days after we sailed being becalmed and the current setting strong to the n n e running as it were into a bay or gulf on the land side we were driven something out of our course and once or twice our men cried land to the westward but whether it was the continent or islands we could not tell by any means but the third day towards evening the sea smooth and the weather calm we saw the sea as it were covered towards the land with something very black not being able to discover what it was but after some time our chief mate going up the main shrouds a little way and looking at them with a perspective cried out it was an army i could not imagine what he meant by an army and spoke a little hastily calling the fellow a fool or some such word nay sir says he don t be angry for it is an army and a fleet too for i believe there are a thousand canoes and you may see them paddle along and they are coming towards us too apace and full of men i was a little surprised then indeed and so was my nephew the captain for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island and having never been in those seas before that he could not tell what to think of it but said two or three times we should all be devoured i must confess considering we were becalmed and the current set strong towards the shore i liked it the worse however i bade him not be afraid but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we must engage them the weather continued calm and they came on apace towards us so i gave orders to come to an anchor and furl all our sails as for the savages i told them they had nothing to fear from them but fire and therefore they should get their boats out and fasten them one close by the head and the other by the stern and man them both well and wait the issue in that posture this i did that the men in the boats might be ready with sheet and buckets to put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix upon the outside of the ship in this posture we lay by for them and in a little while they came up with us but never was such a horrid sight seen by christians my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number i mean of a thousand canoes the most we could make of them when they came up being about 126 and a great many of them too for some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them some more and the least six or seven when they came nearer to us they seemed to be struck with wonder and astonishment as at a sight which they had doubtless never seen before nor could they at first as we afterwards understood know what to make of us they came boldly up however very near to us and seemed to go about to row round us but we called to our men in the boats not to let them come too near them this very order brought us to an engagement with them without our designing it for five or six of the large canoes came so near our long boat that our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back which they understood very well and went back but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats and one of our men in the long boat was very much wounded however i called to them not to fire by any means but we handed down some deal boards into the boat and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence like waste boards to cover them from the arrows of the savages if they should shoot again about half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body astern of us and so near that we could easily discern what they were though we could not tell their design and i easily found they were some of my old friends the same sort of savages that i had been used to engage with in a short time more they rowed a little farther out to sea till they came directly broadside with us and then rowed down straight upon us till they came so near that they could hear us speak upon this i ordered all my men to keep close lest they should shoot any more arrows and made all our guns ready but being so near as to be within hearing i made friday go out upon the deck and call out aloud to them in his language to know what they meant whether they understood him or not that i knew not but as soon as he had called to them six of them who were in the foremost or nearest boat to us turned their canoes from us and stooping down showed us their naked backs whether this was a defiance or challenge we knew not or whether it was done in mere contempt or as a signal to the rest but immediately friday cried out they were going to shoot and unhappily for him poor fellow they let fly about three hundred of their arrows and to my inexpressible grief killed poor friday no other man being in their sight the poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows and about three more fell very near him such unlucky marksmen they were i was so annoyed at the loss of my old trusty servant and companion that i immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot and four with great and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard in their lives before they were not above half a cable s length off when we fired and our gunners took their aim so well that three or four of their canoes were overset as we had reason to believe by one shot only the ill manners of turning up their bare backs to us gave us no great offence neither did i know for certain whether that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them or not therefore in return i had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with powder only which i knew would frighten them sufficiently but when they shot at us directly with all the fury they were capable of and especially as they had killed my poor friday whom i so entirely loved and valued and who indeed so well deserved it i thought myself not only justifiable before god and man but would have been very glad if i could have overset every canoe there and drowned every one of them i can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we wounded at this broadside but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen among such a multitude there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all and the men all set a swimming the rest frightened out of their wits scoured away as fast as they could taking but little care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot so i suppose that many of them were lost and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life above an hour after they were all gone our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great many but in short we never knew any thing how it went with them for they fled so fast that in three hours or thereabouts we could not see above three or four straggling canoes nor did we ever see the rest any more for a breeze of wind springing up the same evening we weighed and set sail for the brasils we had a prisoner indeed but the creature was so sullen that he would neither eat nor speak and we all fancied he would starve himself to death but i took a way to cure him for i made them take him and turn him into the long boat and make him believe they would toss him into the sea again and so leave him where they found him if he would not speak nor would that do but they really did throw him into the sea and came away from him and then he followed them for he swam like a cork and called to them in his tongue though they knew not one word of what he said however at last they took him in again and then he began to be more tractable nor did i ever design they should drown him we were now under sail again but i was the most disconsolate creature alive for want of my man friday and would have been very glad to have gone back to the island to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion but it could not be so we went on we had one prisoner as i have said and it was a long while before we could make him understand any thing but in time our men taught him some english and he began to be a little tractable afterwards we inquired what country he came from but could make nothing of what he said for his speech was so odd all gutturals and spoken in the throat in such a hollow and odd manner that we could never form a word from him and we were all of opinion that they might speak that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth tongue lips or palate but formed their words just as a hunting horn forms a tune with an open throat he told us however some time after when we had taught him to speak a little english that they were going with their kings to fight a great battle when he said kings we asked him how many kings he said there were five nation we could not make him understand the plural s and that they all joined to go against two nation we asked him what made them come up to us he said to makee te great wonder look where it is to be observed that all those natives as also those of africa when they learn english they always add two e s at the end of the words where we use one and place the accent upon the last of them as makee takee and the like and we could not break them of it nay i could hardly make friday leave it off though at last he did and now i name the poor fellow once more i must take my last leave of him poor honest friday we buried him with all decency and solemnity possible by putting him into a coffin and throwing him into the sea and i caused them to fire eleven guns for him and so ended the life of the most grateful faithful honest and most affectionate servant that ever man had we now went away with a fair wind for brasil and in about twelve days time we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of the line being the north easternmost land of all that part of america we kept on s by e in sight of the shore four days when we made the cape st augustine and in three days came to an anchor off the bay of all saints the old place of my deliverance from whence came both my good and evil fate never did a ship come to this part that had less business than i had and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least correspondence on shore not my partner himself who was alive and made a great figure among them not my two merchant trustees nor the fame of my wonderful preservation in the island could obtain me that favour but my partner remembering that i had given five hundred moidores to the prior of the monastery of the augustines and three hundred and seventy two to the poor went to the monastery and obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor and beg leave for me presently with the captain and one more besides eight seamen to come on shore and no more and this upon condition absolutely capitulated for that we should not offer to land any goods out of the ship or to carry any person away without licence they were so strict with us as to landing any goods that it was with extreme difficulty that i got on shore three bales of english goods such as fine broad cloths stuffs and some linen which i had brought for a present to my partner he was a very generous broad hearted man though like me he came from little at first and though he knew not that i had the least design of giving him any thing he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions wine and sweetmeats worth above thirty moidores including some tobacco and three or four fine medals in gold but i was even with him in my present which as i have said consisted of fine broad cloth english stuffs lace and fine hollands also i delivered him about the value of 100 l sterling in the same goods for other uses and i obliged him to set up the sloop which i had brought with me from england as i have said for the use of my colony in order to send the refreshments i intended to my plantation accordingly he got hands and finished the sloop in a very few days for she was already framed and i gave the master of her such instruction as he could not miss the place nor did he miss it as i had an account from my partner afterwards i got him soon loaded with the small cargo i had sent them and one of our seamen that had been on shore with me there offered to go with the sloop and settle there upon my letter to the governor spaniard to allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation and giving him some clothes and tools for his planting work which he said he understood having been an old planter in maryland and a buccaneer into the bargain i encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired and as an addition i gave him the savage which we had taken prisoner of war to be his slave and ordered the governor spaniard to give him his share of everything he wanted with the rest when we came to fit this man out my old partner told me there was a certain very honest fellow a brasil planter of his acquaintance who had fallen into he displeasure of the church i know not what the matter is with him says he but on my conscience i think he is a heretic in his heart and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the inquisition that he would be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape with his wife and two daughters and if i would let them go to the island and allot them a plantation he would give them a small stock to begin with for the officers of the inquisition had seized all his effects and estate and he had nothing left but a little household stuff and two slaves and adds he though i hate his principles yet i would not have him fall into their hands for he will assuredly be burnt alive if he does i granted this presently and joined my englishman with them and we concealed the man and his wife and daughters on board our ship till the sloop put out to go to sea and then having put all their goods on board the sloop some time before we put them on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner and their stock indeed was much alike rich in tools and in preparations for a farm but nothing to begin with but as above however they carried over with them which was worth all the rest some materials for planting sugar canes with some plants of canes which he i mean the portugal man understood very well among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in the island i sent them by this sloop three milch cows and five calves about twenty two hogs among them three sows big with pig two mares and a stone horse for my spaniards according to my promise i engaged three portugal women to go and recommended it to them to marry them and use them kindly i could have procured more women but i remembered that the poor persecuted man had two daughters and there were but five of the spaniards that wanted the rest had wives of their own though in another country all this cargo arrived safe and as you may easily suppose very welcome to my old inhabitants who were now with this addition between sixty and seventy people besides little children of which there were a great many i found letters at london from them all by way of lisbon when i came back to england being sent back to the brasils by this sloop of which i shall take some notice in its place i have now done with my island and all manner of discourse about it and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it and expect to read only of the follies of an old man not warned by his own harms much less by those of other men to beware of the like not cooled by almost forty years misery and disappointments not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation not made cautious by affliction and distress beyond irritation i had no more business to go to the east indies than a man at full liberty and having committed no crime has to go to the turnkey at newgate and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there and starve him had i taken a small vessel from england and gone directly to the island had i loaded her as i did the other vessel with all the necessaries for the plantation and for my people took a patent from the government here to have secured my property in subjection only to that of england which to be sure i might have obtained had i carried over cannon and ammunition servants and people to plant and taking possession of the place fortified and strengthened it in the name of england and increased it with people as i might easily have done had i then settled myself there and sent the ship back loaded with good rice as i might also have done in six months time and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again for our supply had i done this and staid there myself i had at least acted like a man of common sense but i was possessed with a wandering spirit scorned all advantages pleased myself with being the patron of these people i had placed there and doing for them in a kind of haughty majestic way like an old patriarchal monarch providing for them as if i had been father of the whole family as well as of the plantation but i never so much as pretended to plant in the name of any government or nation or to acknowledge any prince or to call my people subjects to any one nation more than another nay i never so much as gave the place a name but left it as i found it belonging to no man and the people under no discipline or government but my own who though i had an influence over them as father and benefactor had no authority or power to act or command one way or other farther than voluntary consent moved them to comply yet even this had i staid there would have done well enough but as i rambled from them and came thither no more the last letters i had from any of them were by my partner s means who afterwards sent another sloop to the place and who sent me word though i had not the letter till five years after it was written that they went on but poorly were malecontent with their long stay there that will atkins was dead that five of the spaniards were come away and that though they had not been much molested by the savages yet they had had some skirmishes with them that they begged of him to write to me to think of the promise i had made to fetch them away that they might see their own country again before they died but i was gone a wild goose chase indeed and they who will have any more of me must be content to follow me through a new variety of follies hardships and wild adventures wherein the justice of providence may be duly observed and we may see how easily heaven can gorge us with our own desires make the strongest of our wishes to be our affliction and punish us most severely with those very things which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in let no wise man flatter himself with the strength of his own judgment as if he was able to choose any particular station of life for himself man is a short sighted creature sees but a very little way before him and as his passions are none of his best friends so his particular affections are generally his worst counsellors i say this with respect to the impetuous desire i had from a youth to wander into the world and how evident it now was that this principle was preserved in me for my punishment how it came on the manner the circumstance and the conclusion of it it is easy to give you historically and with its utmost variety of particulars but the secret ends of divine providence in thus permitting us to be hurried down the stream of our own desires are only to be understood of those who can listen to the voice of providence and draw religious consequences from god s justice and their own mistakes be it had i business or no business away i went it is no time now to enlarge any farther upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct but to come to the history i was embarked for the voyage and the voyage i went i shall only add here that my honest and truly pious clergyman left me here a ship being ready to go to lisbon he asked me leave to go thither being still as he observed bound never to finish any voyage he began how happy had it been for me if i had gone with him but it was too late now all things heaven appoints are best had i gone with him i had never had so many things to be thankful for and you had never heard of the second part of the travels and adventures of robinson crusoe so i must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at myself and go on with my voyage from the brasils we made directly away over the atlantic sea to the cape de bonne esperance or as we call it the cape of good hope and had a tolerable good voyage our course generally south east now and then a storm and some contrary winds but my disasters at sea were at an end my future rubs and cross events were to befal me on shore that it might appear the land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea when heaven who directs the circumstances of things pleases to appoint it to be so our ship was on a trading voyage and had a supercargo on board who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the cape only being limited to a certain number of days for stay by charter party at the several ports she was to go to this was none of my business neither did i meddle with it at all my nephew the captain and the supercargo adjusting all those things between them as they thought fit we made no stay at the cape longer than was needful to take in fresh water but made the best of our way for the coast of coromandel we were indeed informed that a french man of war of fifty guns and two large merchant ships were gone for the indies and as i knew we were at war with france i had some apprehensions of them but they went their own way and we heard no more of them i shall not pester my account or the reader with descriptions of places journals of our voyages variations of the compass latitudes meridian distances trade winds situation of ports and the like such as almost all the histories of long navigation are full of and which make the reading tiresome enough and are perfectly unprofitable to all that read except only to those who are to go to those places themselves it is enough to name the ports and places which we touched at and what occurred to us upon our passing from one to another we touched first at the island of madagascar where though the people are fierce and treacherous and in particular very well armed with lances and bows which they use with inconceivable dexterity yet we fared very well with them awhile they treated us very civilly and for some trifles which we gave them such as knives scissors c they brought us eleven good fat bullocks middling in size but very good in flesh which we took in partly for fresh provisions for our present spending and the rest to salt for the ship s use we were obliged to stay here for some time after we had furnished ourselves with provisions and i that was always too curious to look into every nook of the world wherever i came was for going on shore as often as i could it was on the east side of the island that we went on shore one evening and the people who by the way are very numerous came thronging about us and stood gazing at us at a distance as we had traded freely with them and had been kindly used we thought ourselves in no danger but when we saw the people we cut three boughs out of a tree and stuck them up at a distance from us which it seems is a mark in the country not only of truce and friendship but when it is accepted the other side set up three poles or boughs also which is a signal that they accept the truce too but then this is a known condition of the truce that you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards them nor they come past your three poles or boughs towards you so that you are perfectly secure within the three poles and all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a market for free converse traffic and commerce when you go thither you must not carry your weapons with you and if they come into that space they stick up their javelins and lances all at the first poles and come on unarmed but if any violence is offered them and the truce thereby broken away they run to the poles and lay hold of their weapons and then the truce is at an end it happened one evening when we went on shore that a greater number of their people came down than usual but all was very friendly and civil they brought with them several kinds of provisions for which we satisfied them with such toys as we had their women also brought us milk and roots and several things very acceptable to us and all was quiet and we made us a little tent or hut of some boughs of trees and lay on shore all that night i know not what was the occasion but i was not so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest and the boat lying at an anchor about a stone s cast from the land with two men in her to take care of her i made one of them come on shore and getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat i spread the sail on the bottom of the boat and lay on board under the cover of the branches of the trees all night about two o clock in the morning we heard one of our men make a terrible noise on the shore calling out for god s sake to bring the boat in and come and help them for they were all like to be murdered at the same time i heard the firing of five muskets which was the number of the guns they had and that three times over for it seems the natives here were not so easily frighted with guns as the savages were in america where i had to do with them all this while i knew not what was the matter but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise i caused the boat to be thrust in and resolved with three fusils we had on board to land and assist our men we got the boat soon to the shore but our men were in too much haste for being come to the shore they plunged into the water to get to the boat with all the expedition they could being pursued by between three and four hundred men our men were but nine in all and only five of them had fusils with them the rest indeed had pistols and swords but they were of small use to them we took up seven of our men and with difficulty enough too three of them being very ill wounded and that which was still worse was that while we stood in the boat to take our men in we were in as much danger as they were in on shore for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick that we were fain to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches and two or three loose boards which to our great satisfaction we had by mere accident or providence rather in the boat and yet had it been daylight they are it seems such exact marksmen that if they could have seen but the least part of any of us they would have been sure of us we had by the light of the moon a little sight of them as they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows and having got ready our fire arms we gave them a volley and we could hear by the cries of some of them that we had wounded several however they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day which we suppose was that they might see the better to take their aim at us in this condition we lay and could not tell how to weigh our anchor or set up our sail because we must needs stand up in the boat and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot we made signals of distress to the ship which though she rode a league off yet my nephew the captain hearing our firing and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in and that we fired towards the shore pretty well understood us and weighing anchor with all speed he stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship and then sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us but we called to them not to come too near telling them what condition we were in however they stood in nearer to us and one of the men taking the end of a tow line in his hand and keeping our boat between him and the enemy so that they could not perfectly see him swam on board us and made the line fast to the boat upon which we slipt our little cable and leaving our anchor behind they towed us out of the reach of the arrows we all the while lying close behind the barricade we had made as soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore that she could lay her side to the shore we ran along just by them and we poured in a broadside among them loaded with pieces of iron and lead small bullets and such stuff besides the great shot which made a terrible havoc among them when we were got on board and out of danger we had time to examine into the occasion of this fray and indeed our supercargo who had been often in those parts put me upon it for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us after we had made a truce if we had not done something to provoke them to it at length it came out viz that an old woman who had come to sell us some milk had brought it within our poles with a young woman with her who also brought some roots or herbs and while the old woman whether she was mother to the young woman or no they could not tell was selling us the milk one of our men offered some rudeness to the wench that was with her at which the old woman made a great noise however the seaman would not quit his prize but carried her out of the old woman s sight among the trees it being almost dark the old woman went away without her and as we suppose made an outcry among the people she came from who upon notice raised this great army upon us in three or four hours and it was great odds but we had been all destroyed one of our men was killed with a lance that was thrown at him just at the beginning of the attack as he sallied out of the tent we had made the rest came off free all but the fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief who paid dear enough for his black mistress for we could not hear what became of him a great while we lay upon the shore two days after though the wind presented and made signals for him made our boat sail up shore and down shore several leagues but in vain so we were obliged to give him over and if he alone had suffered for it the loss had been the less i could not satisfy myself however without venturing on shore once more to try if i could learn any thing of him or them it was the third night after the action that i had a great mind to learn if i could by any means what mischief he had done and how the game stood on the indian side i was careful to do it in the dark lest we should be attacked again but i ought indeed to have been sure that the men i went with had been under my command before i engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as i was brought into it without my knowledge or desire we took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship besides the supercargo and myself and we landed two hours before midnight at the same place where the indians stood drawn up the evening before i landed here because my design as i have said was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field and if they had left any marks behind them or of the mischief we had done them and i thought if we could surprise one or two of them perhaps we might get our man again by way of exchange we landed without any noise and divided our men into two companies whereof the boatswain commanded one and i the other we neither could hear nor see any body stir when we landed so we marched up one body at a distance from the other to the field of battle at first we could see nothing it being very dark but by and by our boatswain that led the first party stumbled and fell over a dead body this made them halt there awhile for knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place where the indians had stood they waited for my coming up here we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise which we knew would be in less than an hour and then we could easily discern the havoc we had made among them we told two and thirty bodies upon the ground whereof two were not quite dead some had an arm and some a leg shot off and one his head those that were wounded we supposed they had carried away when we had made as i thought a full discovery of all we could come at the knowledge of i was for going on board again but the boatswain and his party often sent me word that they were resolved to make a visit to the indian town where these dogs as they called them dwelt and desired me to go along with them and if they could find them as they still fancied they should they did not doubt they said getting a good booty and it might be they might find thomas jeffrys there that was the man s name we had lost had they sent to ask my leave to go i knew well enough what answer to have given them for i would have commanded them instantly on board knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run who had a ship and a ship s loading in our charge and a voyage to make which depended very much upon the lives of the men but as they sent me word they were resolved to go and only asked me and my company to go along with them i positively refused it and rose up for i was sitting on the ground in order to go to the boat one or two of the men began to importune me to go and when i still refused positively began to grumble and say they were not under my command and they would go come jack says one of the men will you go with me i will go for one jack said he would and another followed and then another and in a word they all left me but one whom with much difficulty too i persuaded to stay so the supercargo and i with one man went back to the boat where i told them we would stay for them and take care to take in as many of them as should be left for i told them it was a mad thing they were going about and supposed most of them would run the fate of thomas jeffrys they told me like seamen they would warrant it they would come off again and they would take care c so away they went i entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage that their lives were not their own and that they were entrusted with the voyage in some measure that if they miscarried the ship might be lost for want of their help and that they could not answer it to god and man i said a great deal more to them on that head but i might as well have talked to the main mast of the ship they were mad upon their journey only they gave me good words and begged i would not be angry said they would be very cautious and they did not doubt but they would be back again in about an hour at farthest for the indian town they said was not above half a mile off though they found it above two miles before they got to it well they all went away as above and though the attempt was desperate and such as none but madmen would have gone about yet to give them their due they went about it warily as well as boldly they were gallantly armed that is true for they had every man a fusil or musket a bayonet and every man a pistol some of them had broad cutlasses some of them hangers and the boatswain and two more had pole axes besides all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes bolder fellows and better provided never went about any wicked work in the world when they went out their chief design was plunder and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there but a circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge and made devils of them all when they came to the few indian houses which they thought had been the town which were not above half a mile off they were under a great disappointment for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses and where the town was or how big they knew not they consulted therefore what to do and were some time before they could resolve for if they fell upon these they must cut all their throats and it was ten to one but some of them might escape it being in the night though the moon was up and if one escaped he would run away and raise all the town so they should have a whole army upon them again on the other hand if they went away and left those untouched for the people were all asleep they could not tell which way to look for the town however the last was the best advice so they resolved to leave those houses and look for the town as well as they could they went on a little way and found a cow tied to a tree this they presently concluded would be a good guide to them for they said the cow certainly belonged to the town before them or the town behind them and if they untied her they should see which way she went if she went back they had nothing to say to her but if she went forward they had nothing to do but to follow her so they cut the cord which was made of twisted flags and the cow went on before them in a word the cow led them directly to the town which as they reported consisted of above two hundred houses or huts and in some of these they found several families living together here they found all silent as profoundly secure as sleep and a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind could make them upon this they called another council to consider what they had to do and in a word they resolved to divide themselves into three bodies and to set three houses on fire in three parts of the town and as the men came out to seize them and bind them if any resisted they need not be asked what to do then and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder but resolved to march silently first through the town and see what dimensions it was of and consider if they might venture upon it or no they did so and desperately resolved that they would venture upon them but while they were animating one another to the work three of them that were a little before the rest called out aloud and told them they had found thomas jeffrys they all ran up to the place and so it was indeed for there they found the poor fellow hanged up naked by one arm and his throat cut there was an indian house just by the tree where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal indians who had been concerned in the fray with us before and two or three of them wounded with our shot and our men found they were awake and talking one to another in that house but knew not their number the sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them as before that they swore to one another they would be revenged and that not an indian who came into their hands should have quarter and to work they went immediately and yet not so madly as by the rage and fury they were in might be expected their first care was to get something that would soon take fire but after a little search they found that would be to no purpose for most of the houses were low and thatched with flags or rushes of which the country is full so they presently made some wildfire as we call it by wetting a little powder in the palms of their hands and in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five places and particularly that house where the indians were not gone to bed as soon as the fire began to blaze the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save their lives but met with their fate in the attempt and especially at the door where they drove them back the boatswain himself killing one or two with his pole axe the house being large and many in it he did not care to go in but called for an hand grenado and threw it among them which at first frighted them but when it burst made such havoc among them that they cried out in a hideous manner in short most of the indians who were in the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the grenado except two or three more who pressed to the door which the boatswain and two more kept with the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces and dispatched all who came that way but there was another apartment in the house where the prince or king or whatsoever he was and several others were and they kept in till the house which was by this time all of a light flame fell in upon them and they were smothered or burnt together all this while they fired not a gun because they would not waken the people faster than they could master them but the fire began to waken them fast enough and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in bodies for the fire grew so raging all the houses being made of light combustible stuff that they could hardly bear the street between them and their business was to follow the fire for the surer execution as fast as the fire either forced the people out of those houses which were burning or frighted them out of others our people were ready at their doors to knock them on the head still calling and hallooing to one another to remember thomas jeffrys while this was doing i must confess i was very uneasy and especially when i saw the flames of the town which it being night seemed to be just by me my nephew the captain who was roused by his men too seeing such a fire was very uneasy not knowing what the matter was or what danger i was in especially hearing the guns too for by this time they began to use their fire arms a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo what should become of us and at last though he could ill spare any more men yet not knowing what exigence we might be in he takes another boat and with thirteen men and himself comes on shore to me he was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat with no more than two men for one had been left to keep the boat and though he was glad that we were well yet he was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing for the noise continued and the flame increased i confess it was next to an impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity of knowing what had happened or their concern for the safety of the men in a word the captain told me he would go and help his men let what would come i argued with him as i did before with the men the safety of the ship and the danger of the voyage the interest of the owners and merchants c and told him i would go and the two men and only see if we could at a distance learn what was like to be the event and come back and tell him it was all one to talk to my nephew as it was to talk to the rest before he would go he said and he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship for he could not think of having his men lost for want of help he had rather he said lose the ship the voyage and his life and all and so away went he nor was i any more able to stay behind now than i was to persuade them not to go before so in short the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace and fetch twelve men more from the ship leaving the long boat at an anchor and that when they came back six men should keep the two boats and six more come after us so that he left only sixteen men in the ship for the whole ship s company consisted of sixty five men whereof two were lost in the first quarrel which brought this mischief on being now on the march you may be sure we felt little of the ground we trod on and being guided by the fire we kept no path but went directly to the place of the flame if the noise of the guns were surprising to us before the cries of the poor people were now quite of another nature and filled us with horror i must confess i never was at the sacking of a city or at the taking of a town by storm i have heard of oliver cromwell taking drogheda in ireland and killing man woman and child and i had read of count tilly sacking the city of magdebourg and cutting the throats of 22 000 of both sexes but i never had an idea of the thing itself before nor is it possible to describe it or the horror which was upon our minds at hearing it however we went on and at length came to the town though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire the first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house or rather the ashes of it for the house was consumed and just before it plain now to be seen by the light of the fire lay four men and three women killed and as we thought one or two more lay in the heap among the fire in short these were such instances of a rage altogether barbarous and of a fury something beyond what was human that we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it or if they were the authors of it we thought that every one of them ought to be put to the worst of deaths but this was not all we saw the fire increased forward and the cry went on just as the fire went on so that we were in the utmost confusion we advanced a little way farther and beheld to our astonishment three women naked crying in a most dreadful manner and flying as if they had indeed had wings and after them sixteen or seventeen men natives in the same terror and consternation with three of our english butchers for i can call them no better in the rear who when they could not overtake them fired in among them and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight when the rest saw us believing us to be their enemies and that we would murder them as well as those that pursued them they set up a most dreadful shriek especially the women and two of them fell down as if already dead with the fright my very soul shrunk within me and my blood ran chill in my veins when i saw this and i believe had the three english sailors that pursued them come on i had made our men kill them all however we took some ways to let the poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them and immediately they came up to us and kneeling down with their hands lifted up made piteous lamentations to us to save them which we let them know we would do where upon they kept all together in a huddle close behind us for protection i left my men drawn up together and charged them to hurt nobody but if possible to get at some of our people and see what devil it was possessed them and what they intended to do and in a word to command them off assuring them that if they staid till daylight they would have a hundred thousand men about their ears i say i left them and went among those flying people taking only two of our men with me and there was indeed a piteous spectacle among them some of them had their feet terribly burnt with trampling and running through the fire others their hands burnt one of the women had fallen down in the fire and was almost burnt to death before she could get out again two or three of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs from our men pursuing and another was shot through the body and died while i was there i would fain have learnt what the occasion of all this was but i could not understand one word they said though by signs i perceived that some of them knew not what was the occasion themselves i was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt that i could not stay there but went back to my own men i told them my resolution and commanded them to follow me when in the very moment came four of our men with the boatswain at their head running over the heaps of bodies they had killed all covered with blood and dust as if they wanted more people to massacre when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo and with much ado one of them made them hear so that they knew who we were and came up to us as soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a halloo like a shout of triumph for having as he thought more help come and without bearing to hear me captain says he noble captain i am glad you are come we have not half done yet villains hell hound dogs i will kill as many of them as poor tom has hairs upon his head we have sworn to spare none of them we will root out the very name of them from the earth and thus he ran on out of breath too with action and would not give us leave to speak a word at last raising my voice that i might silence him a little barbarous dog said i what are you doing i won t have one creature touched more upon pain of death i charge you upon your life to stop your hands and stand still here or you are a dead man this minute why sir says he do you know what you do or what they have done if you want a reason for what we have done come hither and with that he shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree with his throat cut i confess i was urged then myself and at another time should have been forward enough but i thought they had carried their rage too far and thought of jacob s words to his sons simeon and levi cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel but i had now a new task upon my hands for when the men i carried with me saw the sight as i had done i had as much to do to restrain them as i should have had with the others nay my nephew himself fell in with them and told me in their hearing that he was only concerned for fear of the men being overpowered for as to the people he thought not one of them ought to live for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man and that they ought to be used like murderers upon these words away ran eight of my men with the boatswain and his crew to complete their bloody work and i seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them came away pensive and sad for i could not bear the sight much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands i got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two men and with these i walked back to the boats it was a very great piece of folly in me i confess to venture back as it were alone for as it began now to be almost day and the alarm had run over the country there stood about forty men armed with lances and bows at the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned before but by accident i missed the place and came directly to the sea side and by that time i got to the sea side it was broad day immediately i took the pinnace and went aboard and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen i observed that about the time i came to the boat side the fire was pretty well out and the noise abated but in about half an hour after i got on board i heard a volley of our men s fire arms and saw a great smoke this as i understood afterwards was our men falling upon the forty men who as i said stood at the few houses on the way of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen and set all those houses on fire but did not meddle with the women or children by the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace our men began to appear they came dropping in some and some not in two bodies and in form as they went out but all in heaps straggling here and there in such a manner that a small force of resolute men might have cut them all off but the dread of them was upon the whole country the people were amazed and surprised and so frighted that i believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but five of our men nor in all this terrible action was there a man who made any considerable defence they were so surprised between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of our men in the dark that they knew not which way to turn themselves for if they fled one way they were met by one party if back again by another so that they were every where knocked down nor did any of our men receive the least hurt except one who strained his foot and another had one of his hands very much burnt i was very angry with my nephew the captain and indeed with all the men in my mind but with him in particular as well for his acting so out of his duty as commander of the ship and having the charge of the voyage upon him as in his prompting rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise my nephew answered me very respectfully but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous manner he was not master of himself neither could he govern his passion he owned he should not have done so as he was commander of the ship but as he was a man and nature moved him he could not bear it as for the rest of the men they were not subject to me at all and they knew it well enough so they took no notice of my dislike the next day we set sail so we never heard any more of it our men differed in the account of the number they killed some said one thing some another but according to the best of their accounts put all together they killed or destroyed about a hundred and fifty people men women and children and left not a house standing in the town as for the poor fellow thomas jeffrys as he was quite dead for his throat was so cut that his head was half off it would do him no service to bring him away so they left him where they found him only took him down from the tree where he was hanged by one hand however just our men thought this action to be i was against them in it and i always after that time told them god would blast the voyage for i looked upon the blood they shed that night to be murder in them for though it is true that they killed thomas jeffrys yet it was as true that jeffrys was the aggressor had broken the truce and had violated or debauched a young woman of theirs who came to our camp innocently and on the faith of their capitulation the boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards on board he said it was true that we seemed to break the truce but really had not and that the war was begun the night before by the natives themselves who had shot at us and killed one of our men without any just provocation so that as we were in a capacity to fight them we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner that though the poor man had taken liberty with a wench he ought not to have been murdered and that in such a villanous manner and that they did nothing but what was just and that the laws of god allowed to be done to murderers one would think this should have been enough to have warned us against going on shore among heathens and barbarians but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at their own experience and their experience seems to be always of most use to them when it is dearest bought we were now bound to the gulf of persia and from thence to the coast of coromandel only to touch at surat but the chief of the supercargo s design lay at the bay of bengal where if he missed of the business outward bound he was to go up to china and return to the coast as he came home the first disaster that befel us was in the gulf of persia where five of our men venturing on shore on the arabian side of the gulf were surrounded by the arabs and either all killed or carried away into slavery the rest of the boat s crew were not able to rescue them and had but just time to get off their boat i began to upbraid them with the just retribution of heaven in this case but the boatswain very warmly told me he thought i went farther in my censures than i could show any warrant for in scripture and referred to the thirteenth of st luke ver 4 where our saviour intimates that those men on whom the tower of siloam fell were not sinners above all the galileans but that which indeed put me to silence in this case was that none of these five men who were now lost were of the number of those who went on shore to the massacre of madagascar so i always called it though our men could not bear the word massacre with any patience and indeed this last circumstance as i have said put me to silence for the present but my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse consequences than i expected and the boatswain who had been the head of the attempt came up boldly to me one time and told me he found that i continually brought that affair upon the stage that i made unjust reflections upon it and had used the men very ill on that account and himself in particular that as i was but a passenger and had no command in the ship or concern in the voyage they were not obliged to bear it that they did not know but i might have some ill design in my head and perhaps call them to an account for it when they came to england and that therefore unless i would resolve to have done with it and also not to concern myself farther with him or any of his affairs he would leave the ship for he did not think it was safe to sail with me among them i heard him patiently enough till he had done and then told him that i did confess i had all along opposed the massacre of madagascar for such i would always call it and that i had on all occasions spoken my mind freely about it though not more upon him than any of the rest that as to my having no command in the ship that was true nor did i exercise any authority only took the liberty of speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all as to what concern i had in the voyage that was none of his business i was a considerable owner of the ship and in that claim i conceived i had a right to speak even farther than i had yet done and would not be accountable to him or any one else and began to be a little warm with him he made but little reply to me at that time and i thought that affair had been over we were at this time in the road to bengal and being willing to see the place i went on shore with the supercargo in the ship s boat to divert myself and towards evening was preparing to go on board when one of the men came to me and told me he would not have me trouble myself to come down to the boat for they had orders not to carry me on board any one may guess what a surprise i was in at so insolent a message and i asked the man who bade him deliver that errand to me he told me the coxswain i said no more to the fellow but bid him let them know he had delivered his message and that i had given him no answer to it i immediately went and round out the supercargo and told him the story adding what i presently foresaw viz that there would certainly be a mutiny in the ship and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship in an indian boat and acquaint the captain of it but i might have spared this intelligence for before i had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on board the boatswain the gunner the carpenter and in a word all the inferior officers as soon as i was gone off in the boat came up to the quarter deck and desired to speak with the captain and there the boatswain making a long harangue for the fellow talked very well and repeating all he had said to me told the captain in a few words that as i was now gone peaceably on shore they were loath to use any violence with me which if i had not gone on shore they would otherwise have done to oblige me to have gone they therefore thought fit to tell him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his command they would perform it faithfully but if i would not quit the ship or the captain oblige me to quit it they would all leave the ship and sail no farther with him and at that word all he turned his face about towards the main mast which was it seems the signal agreed on between them at which all the seamen being got together they cried out one and all one and all my nephew the captain was a man of spirit and of great presence of mind and though he was surprised you may be sure at the thing yet he told them calmly he would consider of the matter but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it he used some arguments with them to shew them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing but it was all in vain they swore and shook hands round before his face that they would go all on shore unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come on board the ship this was a hard article upon him who knew his obligation to me and did not know how i might take it so he began to talk cavalierly to them told them that i was a very considerable owner of the ship and that in justice he could not put me out of my own house that this was next door to serving me as the famous pirate kid had done who made the mutiny in the ship set the captain on shore in an uninhabited island and ran away with the ship that let them go into what ship they would if ever they came to england again it would cost them dear that the ship was mine and that he would not put me out of it and that he would rather lose the ship and the voyage too than disoblige me so much so they might do as they pleased however he would go on shore and talk with me there and invited the boatswain to go with him and perhaps they might accommodate the matter with me but they all rejected the proposal and said they would have nothing to do with me any more neither on board nor on shore and if i came on board they would go on shore well said the captain if you are all of this mind let me go on shore and talk with him so away he came to me with this account a little after the message had been brought to me from the coxswain i was very glad to see my nephew i must confess for i was not without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence set sail and run away with the ship and then i had been stripped naked in a remote country and nothing to help myself in short i had been in a worse case than when i was all alone in the island but they had not come to that length it seems to my great satisfaction and when my nephew told me what they had said to him and how they had sworn and shook hands that they would one and all leave the ship if i was suffered to come on board i told him he should not be concerned at it at all for i would stay onshore i only desired he would take care and send me all my necessary things on shore and leave me a sufficient sum of money and i would find my way to england as well as i could this was a heavy piece of news to my nephew but there was no way to help it but to comply with it so in short he went on board the ship again and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their importunity and had sent for his goods from on board the ship so the matter was over in a very few hours the men returned to their duty and i begun to consider what course i should steer i was now alone in the remotest part of the world as i think i may call it for i was near three thousand leagues by sea farther off from england than i was at my island only it is true i might travel here by land over the great mogul s country to surat might go from thence to bassora by sea up the gulf of persia and from thence might take the way of the caravans over the deserts of arabia to aleppo and scanderoon and from thence by sea again to italy and so overland into france and this put together might be at least a full diameter of the globe but if it were to be measured i suppose it would appear to be a great deal more i had another way before me which was to wait for some english ships which were coming to bengal from achin on the island of sumatra and get passage on board them for england but as i came hither without any concern with the english east india company so it would be difficult to go from hence without their licence unless with great favour of the captains of the ships or of the company s factors and to both i was an utter stranger here i had the particular pleasure speaking by contrarieties to see the ship set sail without me a treatment i think a man in my circumstances scarce ever met with except from pirates running away with a ship and setting those that would not agree with their villany on shore indeed this was the next door to it both ways however my nephew left me two servants or rather one companion and one servant the first was clerk to the purser whom he engaged to go with me and the other was his own servant i took me also a good lodging in the house of an english woman where several merchants lodged some french two italians or rather jews and one englishman here i was handsomely enough entertained and that i might not be said to run rashly upon any thing i stayed here above nine months considering what course to take and how to manage myself i had some english goods with me of value and a considerable sum of money my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight and a letter of credit for more if i had occasion that i might not be straitened whatever might happen i quickly disposed of my goods and to advantage too and as i originally intended i bought here some very good diamonds which of all other things was the most proper for me in my circumstances because i might always carry my whole estate about me after a long stay here and many proposals made for my return to england but none falling to my mind the english merchant who lodged with me and with whom i had contracted an intimate acquaintance came to me one morning countryman says he i have a project to communicate to you which as it suits with my thoughts may for aught i know suit with yours also when you shall have thoroughly considered it here we are posted says he you by accident and i by my own choice in a part of the world very remote from our own country but it is in a country where by us who understand trade and business a great deal of money is to be got if you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds we will hire a ship here the first we can get to our minds you shall be captain i ll be merchant and we will go a trading voyage to china for what should we stand still for the whole world is in motion rolling round and round all the creatures of god heavenly bodies and earthly are busy and vibrant why should we be idle there are no drones says he living in the world but men why should we be of that number i liked this proposal very well and the more because it seemed to be expressed with so much good will and in so friendly a manner i will not say but that i might by my loose and unhinged circumstances be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade and indeed for any thing else or otherwise trade was none of my element however i might perhaps say with some truth that if trade was not my element rambling was and no proposal for seeing any part of the world which i had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me it was however some time before we could get a ship to our mind and when we got a vessel it was not easy to get english sailors that is to say so many as were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick up there after some time we got a mate a boatswain and a gunner english a dutch carpenter and three portuguese foremast men with these we found we could do well enough having indian seamen such as they are to make up there are so many travellers who have written the history of their voyages and travels this way that it would be but very little diversion to any body to give a long account of the places we went to and the people who inhabit there those things i leave to others and refer the reader to those journals and travels of englishmen many of which i find are published and more promised every day it is enough for me to tell you that we made the voyage to achin in the island of sumatra first and from thence to siam where we exchanged some of our wares for opium and for some arrack the first a commodity which bears a great price among the chinese and which at that time was very much wanted there in a word we went up to susham made a very great voyage were eight months out and returned to bengal and i was very well satisfied with my adventure i observe that our people in england often admire how the officers which the company send into india and the merchants which generally stay there get such very good estates as they do and sometimes come home worth sixty seventy and a hundred thousand pounds at a time but it is no wonder or at least we shall see so much farther into it when we consider the innumerable ports and places where they have a free commerce that it will then be no wonder and much less will it be so when we consider that at all those places and ports where the english ships come there is so much and such constant demand for the growth of all other countries that there is a certain vent for the return as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out in short we made a very good voyage and i got so much money by the first adventure and such an insight into the method of getting more that had i been twenty years younger i should have been tempted to have stayed here and sought no farther for making my fortune but what was all this to a man on the wrong side of threescore that was rich enough and came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a covetous desire of getting in it and indeed i think it is with great justice that i now call it a restless desire for it was so when i was at home i was restless to go abroad and now i was abroad i was restless to be at home i say what was this gain to me i was rich enough already nor had i any uneasy desires about getting more money and therefore the profits of the voyage to me were things of no great force to me for the prompting me forward to farther undertakings hence i thought that by this voyage i had made no progress at all because i was come back as i might call it to the place from whence i came as to a home whereas my eye which like that which solomon speaks of was never satisfied with seeing was still more desirous of wandering and seeing i was come into a part of the world which i never was in before and that part in particular which i had heard much of and was resolved to see as much of it as i could and then i thought i might say i had seen all the world that was worth seeing but my fellow traveller and i had different notions i do not name this to insist upon my own for i acknowledge his was most just and the most suited to the end of a merchant s life who when he is abroad upon adventures it is his wisdom to stick to that as the best thing for him which he is like to get the most money by my new friend kept himself to the nature of the thing and would have been content to have gone like a carrier s horse always to the same inn backward and forward provided he could as he called it find his account in it on the other hand mine as old as i was was the notion of a mad rambling boy that never cares to see a thing twice over but this was not all i had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home and yet the most unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go in the interval of these consultations my friend who was always upon the search for business proposed another voyage to me viz among the spice islands and to bring home a load of cloves from the manillas or thereabouts places where indeed the dutch do trade but the islands belong partly to the spaniards though we went not so far but to some other where they have not the whole power as they have at batavia ceylon c we were not long in preparing for this voyage the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into it however at last nothing else offering and finding that really stirring about and trading the profit being so great and as i may say certain had more pleasure in it and more satisfaction to the mind than sitting still which to me especially was the unhappiest part of life i resolved on this voyage too which we made very successfully touching at borneo and several islands whose names i do not remember and came home in about five months we sold our spice which was chiefly cloves and some nutmegs to the persian merchants who carried them away for the gulf and making near five of one we really got a great deal of money my friend when we made up this account smiled at me well now said he with a sort of an agreeable insult upon my indolent temper is not this better than walking about here like a man of nothing to do and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and ignorace of the pagans why truly said i my friend i think it is and i begin to be a convert to the principles of merchandising but i must tell you said i by the way you do not know what i am doing for if once i conquer my backwardness and embark heartily as old as i am i shall harass you up and down the world till i tire you for i shall pursue it so eagerly i shall never let you lie still but to be short with my speculations a little while after this there came in a dutch ship from batavia she was a coaster not an european trader and of about two hundred tons burden the men as they pretended having been so sickly that the captain had not men enough to go to sea with he lay by at bengal and as if having got money enough or being willing for other reasons to go for europe he gave public notice that he would sell his ship this came to my ears before my new partner heard of it and i had a great mind to buy it so i went home to him and told him of it he considered awhile for he was no rash man neither but musing some time he replied she is a little too big but however we will have her accordingly we bought the ship and agreeing with the master we paid for her and took possession when we had done so we resolved to entertain the men if we could to join them with those we had for the pursuing our business but on a sudden they not having received their wages but their share of the money as we afterwards learnt not one of them was to be found we inquired much about them and at length were told that they were all gone together by land to agra the great city of the mogul s residence and from thence were to travel to surat and so by sea to the gulf of persia nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while as that i missed the opportunity of going with them for such a ramble i thought and in such company as would both have guarded me and diverted me would have suited mightily with my great design and i should both have seen the world and gone homewards too but i was much better satisfied a few days after when i came to know what sort of fellows they were for in short their history was that this man they called captain was the gunner only not the commander that they had been a trading voyage in which they were attacked on shore by some of the malaccans who had killed the captain and three of his men and that after the captain was killed these men eleven in number had resolved to run away with the ship which they did and had brought her in at the bay of bengal leaving the mate and five men more on shore of whom we shall hear farther well let them come by the ship how they would we came honestly by her as we thought though we did not i confess examine into things so exactly as we ought for we never inquired any thing of the seamen who if we had examined would certainly have faltered in their accounts contradicted one another and perhaps have contradicted themselves or one how or other we should have seen reason to have suspected them but the man shewed us a bill of sale for the ship to one emanuel clostershoven or some such name for i suppose it was all a forgery and called himself by that name and we could not contradict him and being withal a little too unwary or at least having no suspicion of the thing we went through with our bargain however we picked up some english seamen here after this and some dutch and we now resolved for a second voyage to the south east for cloves c that is to say among the philippine and malacca isles and in short not to fill this part of my story with trifles when what is yet to come is so remarkable i spent from first to last six years in this country trading from port to port backward and forward and with very good success and was now the last year with my partner going in the ship above mentioned on a voyage to china but designing first to go to siam to buy rice in this voyage being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and down a great while in the straits of malacca and among the islands we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas but we found our ship had sprung a leak and we were not able by all our industry to find out where it was this forced us to make for some port and my partner who knew the country better than i did directed the captain to put into the river of cambodia for i had made the english mate one mr thompson captain not being willing to take the charge of the ship upon myself this river lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to siam while we were here and going often on shore for refreshment there comes to me one day an englishman and he was it seems a gunner s mate on board an english east india ship which rode in the same river up at or near the city of cambodia what brought him hither we knew not but he comes up to me and speaking english sir says he you are a stranger to me and i to you but i have something to tell you that very nearly concerns you i looked stedfastly at him a good while and he thought at first i had known him but i did not if it very nearly concerns me said i and not yourself what moves you to tell it me i am moved says he by the imminent danger you are in and for aught i see you have no knowledge of it i know no danger i am in said i but that my ship is leaky and i cannot find it out but i propose to lay her aground to morrow to see if i can find it but sir says he leaky or not leaky find it or not find it you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to morrow when you hear what i have to say to you do you know sir said he the town of cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river and there are two large english ships about five leagues on this side and three dutch well said i and what is that to me why sir says he is it for a man that is upon such adventures as you are to come into a port and not examine first what ships there are there and whether he is able to deal with them i suppose you do not think you are a match for them i was amused very much at his discourse but not amazed at it for i could not conceive what he meant and i turned short upon him and said sir i wish you would explain yourself i cannot imagine what reason i have to be afraid of any of the company s ships or dutch ships i am no interloper what can they have to say to me he looked like a man half angry half pleased and pausing awhile but smiling well sir says he if you think yourself secure you must take your chance i am sorry your fate should blind you against good advice but assure yourself if you do not put to sea immediately you will the very next tide be attacked by five long boats full of men and perhaps if you are taken you will be hanged for a pirate and the particulars be examined into afterwards i thought sir added he i should have met with a better reception than this for doing you a piece of service of such importance i can never be ungrateful said i for any service or to any man that offers me any kindness but it is past my comprehension said i what they should have such a design upon me for however since you say there is no time to be lost and that there is some villanous design in hand against me i will go on board this minute and put to sea immediately if my men can stop the leak or if we can swim without stopping it but sir said i shall i go away ignorant of the reason of all this can you give me no farther light into it i can tell you but part of the story sir says he but i have a dutch seaman here with me and i believe i could persuade him to tell you the rest but there is scarce time for it but the short of the story is this the first part of which i suppose you know well enough viz that you were with this ship at sumatra that there your captain was murdered by the malaccans with three of his men and that you or some of those that were on board with you ran away with the ship and are since turned pirates this is the sum of the story and you will all be seized as pirates i can assure you and executed with very little ceremony for you know merchant ships shew but little law to pirates if they get them in their power now you speak plain english said i and i thank you and though i know nothing that we have done like what you talk of but i am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship yet seeing such work is a doing as you say and that you seem to mean honestly i will be upon my guard nay sir says he do not talk of being upon your guard the best defence is to be out of the danger if you have any regard to your life and the lives of all your men put out to sea without fail at high water and as you have a whole tide before you you will be gone too far out before they can come down for they will come away at high water and as they have twenty miles to come you ll get near two hours of them by the difference of the tide not reckoning the length of the way besides as they are only boats and not ships they will not venture to follow you far out to sea especially if it blows well said i you have been very kind in this what shall i do for you to make you amends sir says he you may not be so willing to make me amends because you may not be convinced of the truth of it i will make an offer to you i have nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship which i came out of england in and the dutchman that is with me has seven months pay due to him if you will make good our pay to us we will go along with you if you find nothing more in it we will desire no more but if we do convince you that we have saved your life and the ship and the lives of all the men in her we will leave the rest to you i consented to this readily and went immediately on board and the two men with me as soon as i came to the ship s side my partner who was on board came on the quarter deck and called to me with a great deal of joy o ho o ho we have stopped the leak say you so said i thank god but weigh the anchor then immediately weigh says he what do you mean by that what is the matter says he ask no questions said i but all hands to work and weigh without losing a minute he was surprised but however he called the captain and he immediately ordered the anchor to be got up and though the tide was not quite done yet a little land breeze blowing we stood out to sea then i called him into the cabin and told him the story at large and we called in the men and they told us the rest of it but as it took us up a great deal of time so before we had done a seaman comes to the cabin door and calls out to us that the captain made him tell us we were chased chased said i by whom and by what by five sloops or boats said the fellow full of men very well said i then it is apparent there is something in it in the next place i ordered all our men to be called up and told them that there was a design to seize the ship and to take us for pirates and asked them if they would stand by us and by one another the men answered cheerfully one and all that they would live and die with us then i asked the captain what way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them for resist them i resolved we would and that to the last drop he said readily that the way was to keep them off with our great shot as long as we could and then to fire at them with our small arms to keep them from boarding us but when neither of these would do any longer we should retire to our close quarters perhaps they had not materials to break open our bulk heads or get in upon us the gunner had in the mean time orders to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of the steerage to clear the deck and load them with musket bullets and small pieces of old iron and what next came to hand and thus we made ready for fight but all this while kept out to sea with wind enough and could see the boats at a distance being five large long boats following us with all the sail they could make two of these boats which by our glasses we could see were english had outsailed the rest were near two leagues a head of them and gained upon us considerably so that we found they would come up with us upon which we fired a gun without a shot to intimate that they should bring to and we put out a flag of truce as a signal for parley but they kept crowding after us till they came within shot upon this we took in our white flag they having made no answer to it hung out the red flag and fired at them with shot notwithstanding this they came on till they were near enough to call to them with a speaking trumpet which we had on board so we called to them and bade them keep off at their peril it was all one they crowded after us and endeavoured to come under our stern so to board us on our quarter upon which seeing they were resolute for mischief and depended upon the strength that followed them i ordered to bring the ship to so that they lay upon our broadside when immediately we fired five guns at them one of them had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat and bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail and running all to the head of the boat to keep her from sinking so she lay by and had enough of it but seeing the foremost boat still crowd on after us we made ready to fire at her in particular while this was doing one of the three boats that was behind being forwarder than the other two made up to the boat which we had disabled to relieve her and we could afterwards see her take out the men we called again to the foremost boat and offered a truce to parley again and to know what was her business with us but had no answer only she crowded close under our stern upon this our gunner who was a very dexterous fellow run out his two chase guns and fired at her but the shot missing the men in the boat shouted waved their caps and came on but the gunner getting quickly ready again fired among them a second time one shot of which though it missed the boat itself yet fell in among the men and we could easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them but we taking no notice of that weared the ship again and brought our quarter to bear upon them and firing three guns more we found the boat was split almost to pieces in particular her rudder and a piece of her stern were shot quite away so they handed their sail immediately and were in great disorder but to complete their misfortune our gunner let fly two guns at them again where he hit them we could not tell but we found the boat was sinking and some of the men already in the water upon this i immediately manned out our pinnace which we had kept close by our side with orders to pick up some of the men if they could and save them from drowning and immediately to come on board with them because we saw the rest of the boats began to come up our men in the pinnace followed their orders and took up three men one of which was just drowning and it was a good while before we could recover him as soon as they were on board we crowded all the sail we could make and stood farther out to sea and we found that when the other three boats came up to the first two they gave over their chase being thus delivered from a danger which though i knew not the reason of it yet seemed to be much greater than i apprehended i took care that we should change our course and not let any one imagine whither we were going so we stood out to sea eastward quite out of the course of all european ships whether they were bound to china or any where else within the commerce of the european nations when we were now at sea we began to consult with the two seamen and inquire first what the meaning of all this should be the dutchman let us into the secret of it at once telling us that the fellow that sold us the ship as we said was no more than a thief that had run away with her then he told us how the captain whose name too he mentioned though i do not remember it now was treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of malacca with three of his men and that he this dutchman and four more got into the woods where they wandered about a great while till at length he in particular in a miraculous manner made his escape and swam off to a dutch ship which sailing near the shore in its way from china had sent their boat on shore for fresh water that he durst not come to that part of the shore where the boat was but made shift in the night to take in the water farther off and swimming a great while at last the ship s boat took him up he then told us that he went to batavia where two of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived having deserted the rest in their travels and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with the ship sold her at bengal to a set of pirates which were gone a cruising in her and that they had already taken an english ship and two dutch ships very richly laden this latter part we found to concern us directly and though we knew it to be false yet as my partner said very well if we had fallen into their hands and they had such a prepossession against us beforehand it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves or to hope for any good quarters at their hands especially considering that our accusers had been our judges and that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated and ungoverned passion have executed and therefore it was his opinion we should go directly back to bengal from whence we came without putting in at any port whatever because there we could give an account of ourselves and could prove where we were when the ship put in whom we bought her of and the like and which was more than all the rest if we were put to the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges we should be sure to have some justice and not be hanged first and judged afterwards i was some time of my partner s opinion but after a little more serious thinking i told him i thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt returning to bengal for that we were on the wrong side of the straits of malacca and that if the alarm was given we should be sure to be waylaid on every side as well by the dutch of batavia as the english elsewhere that if we should be taken as it were running away we should even condemn ourselves and there would want no more evidence to destroy us i also asked the english sailor s opinion who said he was of my mind and that we should certainly be taken this danger a little startled my partner and all the ship s company and we immediately resolved to go away to the coast of tonquin and so on to china and from thence pursuing the first design as to trade find some way or other to dispose of the ship and come back in some of the vessels of the country such as we could get this was approved of as the best method for our security and accordingly we steered away n n e keeping above fifty leagues off from the usual course to the eastward this however put us to some inconvenience for first the winds when we came to that distance from the shore seemed to be more steadily against us blowing almost trade as we call it from the e and e n e so that we were a long while upon our voyage and we were but ill provided with victuals for so long a run and which was still worse there was some danger that those english and dutch ships whose boats pursued us whereof some were bound that way might be got in before us and if not some other ship bound to china might have information of us from them and pursue us with the same vigour i must confess i was now very uneasy and thought myself including the last escape from the long boats to have been in the most dangerous condition that ever i was in through all my past life for whatever ill circumstances i had been in i was never pursued for a thief before nor had i ever done any thing that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent much less thievish i had chiefly been mine own enemy or as i may rightly say i had been nobody s enemy but my own but now i was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable for though i was perfectly innocent i was in no condition to make that innocence appear and if i had been taken it had been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind at least a crime esteemed so among the people i had to do with this made me very anxious to make an escape though which way to do it i knew not or what port or place we should go to my partner seeing me thus dejected though he was the most concerned at first began to encourage me and describing to me the several ports of the coast told me he would put in on the coast of cochinchina or the bay of tonquin intending to go afterwards to macao a town once in the possession or the portuguese and where still a great many european families resided and particularly the missionary priests usually went thither in order to their going forward to china hither we then resolved to go and accordingly though alter a tedious and irregular course and very much straitened for provisions we came within sight of the coast very early in the morning and upon reflection upon the past circumstances we were in and the danger if we had not escaped we resolved to put into a small river which however had depth enough of water for us and to see if we could either overland or by the ship s pinnace come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts this happy step was indeed our deliverance for though we did not immediately see any european ships in the bay of tonquin yet the next morning there came into the bay two dutch ships and a third without any colours spread out but which we believed to be a dutchman passed by at about two leagues distance steering for the coast of china and in the afternoon went by two english ships steering the same course and thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies both one way and the other the place we were in was wild and barbarous the people thieves even by occupation or profession and though it is true we had not much to seek of them and except getting a few provisions cared not how little we had to do with them yet it was with much difficulty that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several ways we were in a small river of this country within a few leagues of its utmost limits northward and by our boat we coasted north east to the point of land which opens to the great bay of tonquin and it was in this beating up along the shore that we discovered as above that in a word we were surrounded with enemies the people we were among were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast having no correspondence with any other nation and dealing only in fish and oil and such gross commodities and it may be particularly seen that they are as i said the most barbarous of any of the inhabitants viz that among other customs they have this one that if any vessel had the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast they presently make the men all prisoners that is to say slaves and it was not long before we found a spice of their kindness this way on the occasion following i have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea and that we could not find it out and however it happened that as i have said it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy minute of our being to be seized by the dutch and english ships near the bay of siam yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired we resolved while we were in this place to lay her on shore take out what heavy things we had on hoard which were not many and to wash and clean her bottom and if possible to find out where the leaks were accordingly having lightened the ship and brought all our guns and other moveable things to one side we tried to bring her down that we might come at her bottom for on second thoughts we did not care to lay her dry aground neither could we find out a proper place for it the inhabitants who had never been acquainted with such a sight came wondering down to the shore to look at us and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner and heeling towards the shore and not seeing our men who were at work on her bottom with stages and with their boats on the off side they presently concluded that the ship was cast away and lay so very fast on the ground on this supposition they came all about us in two or three hours time with ten or twelve large boats having some of them eight some ten men in a boat intending no doubt to have come on board and plunder the ship and if they had found us there to have carried us away for slaves to their king or whatever they call him for we knew not who was their governor when they came up to the ship and began to row round her they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship s bottom and side washing and graving and stopping as every seafaring man knows how they stood for awhile gazing at us and we who were a little surprised could not imagine what their design was but being willing to be sure we took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship and others to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were at work to defend themselves with if there should be occasion and it was no more than need for in less than a quarter of an hour s consultation they agreed it seems that the ship was really a wreck that we were all at work endeavouring to save her or to save our lives by the help of our boats and when we handed our arms into the boats they concluded by that motion that we were endeavouring to save some of our goods upon this they took it for granted they all belonged to them and away they came directly upon our men as if it had been in a line of battle our men seeing so many of them began to be frighted for we lay but in an ill posture to fight and cried out to us to know what they should do i immediately called to the men who worked upon the stages to slip them down and get up the side into the ship and bade those in the boat to row round and come on board and those few of us who were on board worked with all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights but however neither the men upon the stage nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered before the cochinchinese were upon them and with two of their boats boarded our long boat and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners the first man they laid hold of was an english seaman a stout strong fellow who having a musket in his hand never offered to fire it but laid it down in the boat like a fool as i thought but he understood his business better than i could teach him for he grappled the pagan and dragged him by main force out of their own boat into ours where taking him by the two ears he beat his head so against the boat s gunnel that the fellow died instantly in his hands and in the mean time a dutchman who stood next took up the musket and with the but end of it so laid about him that he knocked down five of them who attempted to enter the boat but this was little towards resisting thirty or forty men who fearless because ignorant of their danger began to throw themselves into the long boat where we had but five men to defend it but one accident gave our men a complete victory which deserved our laughter rather than any thing else and that was this our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her to stop the leaks had got two kettles just let down into the boat one filled with boiling pitch and the other with rosin tallow and oil and such stuff as the shipwrights used for that work and the man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand with which he supplied the men that were at work with that hot stuff two of the enemy s men entered the boat just where this fellow stood being in the fore sheets he immediately sainted them with a ladleful of the stuff boiling hot which so burnt and scalded them being half naked that they roared out like two bulls and enraged with the fire leaped both into the sea the carpenter saw it and cried out well done jack give them some more of it when stepping forward himself he takes one of their mops and dipping it in the pitch pot he and his man threw it among them so plentifully that in short of all the men in three boats there was not one that was not scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful pitiful manner and made such a howling and crying that i never heard a worse noise and indeed nothing like it for it was worth observing that though pain naturally makes all people cry out yet every nation have a particular way of exclamation and make noises as different from one another as their speech i cannot give the noise these creatures made a better name than howling nor a name more proper to the tone of it for i never heard any thing more like the noise of the wolves which as i have said i heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of languedoc i was never pleased with a victory better in my life not only as it was a perfect surprise to me and that our danger was imminent before but as we got this victory without any bloodshed except of that man the fellow killed with his naked hands and which i was very much concerned at for i was sick of killing such poor savage wretches even though it was in my own defence knowing they came on errands which they thought just and knew no better and that though it may be a just thing because necessary for there is no necessary wickedness in nature yet i thought it was a sad life when we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow creatures to preserve ourselves and indeed i think so still and i would even now suffer a great deal rather than i would take away the life even of the worst person injuring me i believe also all considering people who know the value of life would be of my opinion if they entered seriously into the consideration of it but to return to my story all the while this was doing my partner and i who managed the rest of the men on board had with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights and having gotten the guns into their places again the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way for he would let fly among them i called back again to him and bid him not offer to fire for the carpenter would do the work without him but bade him heat another pitch kettle which our cook who was on board took care of but the enemy was so terrified with what they met with in their first attack that they would not come on again and some of them that were farthest off seeing the ship swim as it were upright began as we supposed to see their mistake and gave over the enterprise finding it was not as they expected thus we got clear of this merry fight and having gotten some rice and some roots and bread with about sixteen good big hogs on board two days before we resolved to stay here no longer out go forward whatever came of it for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day with rogues enough perhaps more than our pitch kettle would dispose of for us we therefore got all our things on board the same evening and the next morning were ready to sail in the meantime lying at an anchor some distance from the shore we were not so much concerned being now in a lighting posture as well as in a sailing posture if any enemy had presented the next day having finished our work within board and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks we set sail we would have gone into the bay of tonquin for we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the dutch ships that had been there but we durst not stand in there because we had seen several ships go in as we supposed but a little before so we kept on n e towards the isle of formosa as much afraid of being seen by a dutch or english merchant ship as a dutch or english merchant ship in the mediterranean is of an algerine man of war when we were thus got to sea we kept on n e as if we would go to the manillas or the philippine islands and this we did that we might not fall into the way of any of the european ships and then we steered north again till we came to the latitude of 22 degrees 20 minutes by which means we made the island of formosa directly where we came to an anchor in order to get water and fresh provisions which the people there who are very courteous and civil in their manners supplied us with willingly and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their agreements and bargains which is what we did not find among other people and may be owing to the remains of christianity which was once planted here by a dutch mission of protestants and is a testimony of what i have often observed viz that the christian religion always civilizes the people and reforms their manners where it is received whether it works saving effects upon them or not from hence we sailed still north keeping the coast of china at an equal distance till we knew we were beyond all the ports of china where our european ships usually come but being resolved if possible not to fall into any of their hands especially in this country where as our circumstances were we could not fail of being entirely ruined nay so great was my fear in particular as to my being taken by them that i believe firmly i would much rather have chosen to fall into the hands of the spanish inquisition being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees we resolved to put into the first trading port we should come at and standing in for the shore a boat came off two leagues to us with an old portuguese pilot on board who knowing us to be an european ship came to offer his service which indeed we were very glad of and took him on board upon which without asking us whither we would go he dismissed the boat he came in and sent it back i thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old man carry us whither we would that i began to talk with him about carrying us to the gulf of nanquin which is the most northern part of the coast of china the old man said he knew the gulf of nanquin very well but smiling asked us what we would do there i told him we would sell our cargo and purchase china wares calicoes raw silks tea wrought silks c and so would return by the same course we came he told us our best port had been to have put in at macao where we could not fail of a market for our opium to our satisfaction and might for our money have purchased all sorts of china goods as cheap as we could at nanquin not being able to put the old man out of his talk of which he was very opinionated or conceited i told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants and that we had a mind to go and see the great city of pekin and the famous court of the monarch of china why then says the old man you should go to ningpo where by the river that runs into the sea there you may go up within five leagues of the great canal this canal is a navigable made stream which goes through the heart of all that vast empire of china crosses all the rivers passes some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates and goes up to the city of pekin being in length near two hundred and seventy leagues well said i seignior portuguese but that is not our business now the great question is if you can carry us up to the city of nanquin from whence we can travel to pekin afterwards yes he said he could do so very well and there was a great dutch ship gone up that way just before this gave me a little shock a dutch ship was now our terror and we had much rather have met the devil at least if he had not come in too frightful a figure we depended upon it that a dutch ship would be our destruction for we were in no condition to fight them all the ships they trade with in those parts being of great burden and of much greater force than we were the old man found me a little confused and under some concern when he named a dutch ship and said to me sir you need be under no apprehension of the dutch i suppose they are not now at war with your nation no said i that s true but i know not what liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of the laws of their country why said he you are no pirates what need you fear they will not meddle with peaceable merchants sure if i had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at that word it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion imaginable nor was it possible for me to conceal it so but that the old man easily perceived it sir said he i find you are in some disorder in your thoughts at my talk pray be pleased to go which way you think fit and depend upon it i ll do you all the service i can why seignior said i it is true i am a little unsettled in my resolution at this time whither to go in particular and i am something more so for what you said about pirates i hope there are no pirates in these seas we are but in an ill condition to meet with them for you see we have but a small force and but very weakly manned o sir said he do not be concerned i do not know that there have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years except one which was seen as i hear in the bay of siam about a month since but you may be assured she is gone to the southward nor was she a ship of any great force or fit for the work she was not built for a privateer but was run away with by a reprobate crew that were on board after the captain and some of his men had been murdered by the malaccans at or near the island of sumatra what said i seeming to know nothing of the matter did they murder the captain no said he i do not understand that they murdered him but as they afterwards ran away with the ship it is generally believed they betrayed him into the hands of the malaccans who did murder him and perhaps they procured them to do it why then said i they deserved death as much as if they had done it themselves nay said the old man they do deserve it and they will certainly have it if they light upon any english or dutch ship for they have all agreed together that if they meet that rogue they will give him no quarter but said i to him you say the pirate is gone out of these seas how can they meet with him then why that is true said he they do say so but he was as i tell you in the bay of siam in the river cambodia and was discovered there by some dutchmen who belonged to the ship and who were left on shore when they ran away with her and some english and dutch traders being in the river they were within a little of taking him nay said he if the foremost boats had been well seconded by the rest they had certainly taken him but he finding only two boats within reach of him tacked about and fired at these two and disabled them before the others came up and then standing off to sea the others were not able to follow him and so he got away but they have all so exact a description of the ship that they will be sure to know him and where ever they find him they have vowed to give no quarter to either the captain or the seamen but to hang them all up at the yard arm what said i will they execute them right or wrong hang them first and judge them afterwards o sir said the old pilot there is no need to make a formal business of it with such rogues as those let them tie them back to back and set them a diving it is no more than they rightly deserve i knew i had my old man fast aboard and that he could do me no harm so i turned short upon him well seignior said i and this is the very reason why i would have you carry us to nanquin and not to put back to macao or to any other part of the country where the english or dutch ships came for be it known to you seignior those captains of the english and dutch ships are a parcel of rash proud insolent fellows that neither know what belongs to justice or how to behave themselves as the laws of god and nature direct but being proud of their offices and not understanding their power they would get the murderers to punish robbers would take upon them to insult men falsely accused and determine them guilty without due inquiry and perhaps i may live to call some of them to an account of it where they may be taught how justice is to be executed and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the crime and that he is the man with this i told him that this was the very ship they had attacked and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had with their boats and how foolishly and coward like they had behaved i told him all the story of our buying the ship and how the dutchmen served us i told him the reasons i had to believe that this story of killing the master by the malaccans was not true as also the running away with the ship but that it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men were turned pirates and they ought to have been sure it was so before they had ventured to attack us by surprise and oblige us so resist them adding that they would have the blood of those men who were killed there in our just defence to answer for the old man was amazed at this relation and told us we were very much in the right to go away to the north and that if he might advise us it should be to sell the ship in china which we might very well do and buy or build another in the country and said he though you will not get so good a ship yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods back again to bengal or any where else i told him i would take his advice when i came to any port where i could find a ship for my turn or get any customer to buy this he replied i should meet with customers enough for the ship at nanquin and that a chinese junk would serve me very well to go back again and that he would procure me people both to buy one and sell the other well but seignior says i as you say they know the ship so well i may perhaps if i follow your measures be instrumental to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible broil and perhaps be murdered in cold blood for wherever they find the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by proving this was the ship and so innocent men may probably be overpowered and murdered why said the old man i ll find out a way to prevent that also for as i know all those commanders you speak of very well and shall see them all as they pass by i will be sure to set them to rights in the thing and let them know that they had been so much in the wrong that though the people who were on board at first might run away with the ship yet it was not true that they had turned pirates and that in particular those were not the men that first went off with the ship but innocently bought her for their trade and i am persuaded they will so far believe me as at least to act more cautiously for the time to come well said i and will you deliver one message to them from me yes i will says he if you will give it under your hand in writing that i may be able to prove it came from you and not out of my own head i answered that i would readily give it him under my hand so i took a pen and ink and paper and wrote at large the story of assaulting me with the long boats c the pretended reason of it and the unjust cruel design of it and concluded to the commanders that they had done what they not only should have been ashamed or but also that if ever they came to england and i lived to see them there they should all pay dearly for it if the laws of my country were not grown out of use before i arrived there my old pilot read this over and over again and asked me several times if i would stand to it i answered i would stand to it as long as i had any thing left in the world being sensible that i should one time or other find an opportunity to put it home to them but we had no occasion ever to let the pilot carry this letter for he never went back again while those things were passing between us by way of discourse we went forward directly for nanquin and in about thirteen days sail came to anchor at the south west point of the great gulf of nanquin where by the way i came by accident to understand that the two dutch ships were gone that length before me and that i should certainly fall into their hands i consulted my partner again in this exigency and he was as much at a loss as i was and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost any where however i was not in such perplexity neither but i asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour which i might put into and pursue my business with the chinese privately and be in no danger of the enemy he told me if i would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues there was a little port called quinchang where the fathers of the mission usually landed from macao on their progress to teach the christian religion to the chinese and where no european ships ever put in and if i thought proper to put in there i might consider what farther course to take when i was on shore he confessed he said it was not a place for merchants except that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair there when the merchants from japan came over thither to buy the chinese merchandises we all agreed to go back to this place the name of the port as he called it i may perhaps spell wrong for i do not particularly remember it having lost this together with the names of many other places set down in a little pocket book which was spoiled by the water on an accident which i shall relate in its order but this i remember that the chinese or japanese merchants we correspond with call it by a different name from that which our portuguese pilot gave it and pronounced it as above quinchang as we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to this place we weighed the next day having only gone twice on shore where we were to get fresh water on both which occasions the people of the country were very civil to us and brought us abundance of things to sell to us i mean of provisions plants roots tea rice and some fowls but nothing without money we came to the other port the wind being contrary not till five days but it was very much to our satisfaction and i was joyful and i may say thankful when i set my foot safe on shore resolving and my partner too that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects any other way though not every way to our satisfaction we would never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel again and indeed i must acknowledge that of all the circumstances of life that ever i had any experience of nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being in constant fear well does the scripture say the fear of man brings a snare it is a life of death and the mind is so entirely suppressed by it that it is capable of no relief the animal spirits sink and all the vigour of nature which usually supports men under other afflictions and is present to them in the greatest exigencies fails them here nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy by heightening every danger representing the english and dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason or distinguishing between honest men and rogues or between a story calculated for our own turn made out of nothing on purpose to deceive and a true genuine account of our whole voyage progress and design for we might many ways have convinced any reasonable creature that we were not pirates the goods we had on board the course we steered our frankly shewing ourselves and entering into such and such ports even our very manner the force we had the number of men the few arms little ammunition and short provisions all these would have served to convince any man that we were no pirates the opium and other goods we had on board would make it appear the ship had been at bengal the dutchmen who it was said had the names of all the men that were in the ship might easily see that we were a mixture of english portuguese and indians and but two dutchmen on board these and many other particular circumstances might have made it evident to the understanding of any commander whose hands we might fall into that we were no pirates but fear that blind useless passion worked another way and threw us into the vapours it bewildered our understandings and set the imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that perhaps might never happen we first supposed as indeed every body had related to us that the seamen on board the english and dutch ships but especially the dutch were so enraged at the name of a pirate and especially at our beating off their boats and escaping that they would not give themselves leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no but would execute us off hand as we call it without giving us any room for a defence we reflected that there was really so much apparent evidence before them that they would scarce inquire after any more as first that the ship was certainly the same and that some of the seamen among them knew her and had been on board her and secondly that when we had intelligence at the river cambodia that they were coming down to examine us we fought their boats and fled so that we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates as we were satisfied of the contrary and i often said i knew not but i should have been apt to have taken the like circumstances for evidence if the tables were turned and my case was theirs and have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces without believing or perhaps considering what they might have to offer in their defence but let that be how it will those were our apprehensions and both my partner and i too scarce slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard arms that is to say gibbets of fighting and being taken of killing and being killed and one night i was in such a fury in my dream fancying the dutchmen had boarded us and i was knocking one of their seamen down that i struck my double fist against the side of the cabin i lay in with such a force as wounded my hand most gievously broke my knuckles and cut and bruised the flesh so that it not only waked me out of my sleep but i was once afraid i should have lost two of my fingers another apprehension i had was of the cruel usage we should meet with from them if we fell into their hands then the story of amboyna came into my head and how the dutch might perhaps torture us as they did our countrymen there and make some of our men by extremity of torture confess those crimes they never were guilty of own themselves and all of us to be pirates and so they would put us to death with a formal appearance of justice and that they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo which was worth four or five thousand pounds put all together these things tormented me and my partner too night and day nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no authority to act thus and if we had surrendered prisoners to them they could not answer the destroying us or torturing us but would be accountable for it when they came into their own country this i say gave me no satisfaction for if they will act thus with us what advantage would it be to us that they would be called to an account for it or if we were first to be murdered what satisfaction would it be to us to have them punished when they came home i cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections i now had upon the past variety of my particular circumstances how hard i thought it was that i who had spent forty years in a life of continued difficulties and was at last come as it were at the port or haven which all men drive at viz to have rest and plenty should be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice and that i who had escaped so many dangers in my youth should now come to be hanged in my old age and in so remote a place for a crime i was not in the least inclined to much less guilty of and in a place and circumstance where innocence was not like to be any protection at all to me after these thoughts something of religion would come in and i would be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate providence and i ought to look upon it and submit to it as such that although i was innocent as to men i was far from being innocent as to my maker and i ought to look in and examine what other crimes in my life were most obvious to me and for which providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribution and that i ought to submit to this just as i would to a shipwreck if it had pleased god to have brought such a disaster upon me in its turn natural courage would sometimes take its place and then i would be talking myself up to vigorous resolution that i would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in cold blood that it was much better to have fallen into the hands of the savages who were men eaters and who i was sure would feast upon me when they had taken me than by those who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities that in the case of the savages i always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp and why should i not do so now seeing it was much more dreadful to me at least to think of falling into these men s hands than ever it was to think of being eaten by men for the savages give them their due would not eat a man till he was dead and killed him first as we do a bullock but that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death whenever these thoughts prevailed i was sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the agitations of a supposed fight my blood would boil and my eyes sparkle as if i was engaged and i always resolved that i would take no quarter at their hands but even at last if i could resist no longer i would blow up the ship and all that was in her and leave them but little booty to boast of but by how much the greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of those things were to our thoughts while we were at sea by so much the greater was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore and my partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his back which he was to carry up a hill and found that he was not able to stand long under it but the portuguese pilot came and took it off his back and the hill disappeared the ground before him shewing all smooth and plain and truly it was so we were all like men who had a load taken off their backs for my part i had a weight taken off from my heart that i was not able any longer to bear and as i said above we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship when we came on shore the old pilot who was now our friend got us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods which by the way was much the same it was a little house or hut with a large house joining to it all built with canes and palisadoed round with large canes to keep out pilfering thieves of which it seems there were not a few in the country however the magistrates allowed us all a little guard and we had a soldier with a kind of halbert or half pike who stood sentinel at our door to whom we allowed a pint of rice and a little piece of money about the value of three pence per day so that our goods were kept very safe the fair or mart usually kept in this place had been over some time however we found that there were three or four junks in the river and two japanners i mean ships from japan with goods which they had bought in china and were not gone away having japanese merchants on shore the first thing our old portuguese pilot did for us was to bring us acquainted with three missionary romish priests who were in the town and who had been there some time converting the people to christianity but we thought they made but poor work of it and made them but sorry christians when they had done however that was not our business one of these was a frenchman whom they called father simon he was a jolly well conditioned man very free in his conversation not seeming so serious and grave as the other two did one of whom was a portuguese and the other a genoese but father simon was courteous easy in his manner and very agreeable company the other two were more reserved seemed rigid and austere and applied seriously to the work they came about viz to talk with and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants wherever they had opportunity we often ate and drank with those men and though i must confess the conversion as they call it of the chinese to christianity is so far from the true conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of christ that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the name of christ say some prayers to the virgin mary and her son in a tongue which they understand not and to cross themselves and the like yet it must be confessed that these religious whom we call missionaries have a firm belief that these people should be saved and that they are the instrument of it and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage and hazards of living in such places but oftentimes death itself with the most violent tortures for the sake of this work and it would be a great want of charity in us whatever opinion we have of the work itself and the manner of their doing it if we should not have a good opinion of their zeal who undertake it with so many hazards and who have no prospect of the least temporal advantage to themselves but to return to my story this french priest father simon was appointed it seems by order of the chief of the mission to go up to pekin the royal seat of the chinese emperor and waited only for another priest who was ordered to come to him from macao to go along with him and we scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey with him telling me how he would shew me all the glorious things of that mighty empire and among the rest the greatest city in the world a city said he that your london and our paris put together cannot he equal to this was the city of pekin which i confess is very great and infinitely full of people but as i looked on those things with different eyes from other men so i shall give my opinion of them in few words when i come in the course of my travels to speak more particularly of them but first i come to my friar or missionary dining with him one day and being very merry together i showed some little inclination to go with him and he pressed me and my partner very hard and with a great many persuasions to consent why father simon says my partner why should you desire our company so much you know we are heretics and you do not love us nor can keep us company with any pleasure o says he you may perhaps be good catholics in time my business here is to convert heathens and who knows but i may convert you too very well father said i so you will preach to us all the way i won t be troublesome to you said he our religion does not divest us of good manners besides said he we are all here like countrymen and so we are compared to the place we are in and if you are hugonots and i a catholic we may be all christians at last at least said he we are all gentlemen and we may converse so without being uneasy to one another i liked that part of his discourse very well and it began to put me in mind of my priest that i had left in the brasils but this father simon did not come up to his character by a great deal for though father simon had no appearance of a criminal levity in him neither yet he had not that fund of christian zeal strict piety and sincere affection to religion that my other good ecclesiastic had of whom i have said so much but to leave him a little though he never left us nor soliciting us to go with him but we had something else before us at that time for we had all this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of and we began to be very doubtful what we should do for we were now in a place of very little business and once i was about to venture to sail for the river of kilam and the city of nanquin but providence seemed now more visibly as i thought than ever to concern itself in our affairs and i was encouraged from this very time to think i should one way or other get out of this entangled circumstance and be brought home to my own country again though i had not the least view of the manner and when i began sometimes to think of it could not imagine by what method it was to be done providence i say began here to clear up our way a little and the first thing that offered was that our old portuguese pilot brought a japan merchant to us who began to inquire what goods we had and in the first place he bought all our opium and gave us a very good price for it paying us in gold by weight some in small pieces of their own coin and some in small wedges of about ten or eleven ounces each while we were dealing with him for our opium it came into my head that he might perhaps deal with us for the ship too and i ordered the interpreter to propose it to him he shrunk up his shoulders at it when it was first proposed to him but in a few days after he came to me with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter and told me he had a proposal to make to me and that was this he had bought a great quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts or proposals made to him of buying the ship and that therefore he had not money enough to pay for the ship but if i would let the same men who were in the ship navigate her he would hire the ship to go to japan and would send them from thence to the philippine islands with another loading which he would pay the freight of before they went from japan and that at their return he would buy the ship i began to listen to this proposal and so eager did my head still run upon rambling that i could not but begin to entertain a notion myself of going with him and so to sail from the philippine islands away to the south seas and accordingly i asked the japanese merchant if he would not hire us to the philippine islands and discharge us there he said no he could not do that for then he could not have the return of his cargo but he would discharge us in japan he said at the ship s return well still i was for taking him at that proposal and going myself but my partner wiser than myself persuaded me from it representing the dangers as well of the seas as of the japanese who are a false cruel treacherous people and then of the spaniards at the philippines more false more cruel more treacherous than they but to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion the first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the ship and with the men and know if they were willing to go to japan and while i was doing this the young man whom as i said my nephew had left with me as my companion for my travels came to me and told me that he thought that voyage promised very fair and that there was a great prospect of advantage and he would be very glad if i undertook it but that if i would not and would give him leave he would go as a merchant or how i pleased to order him and if ever he came to england and i was there and alive he would render me a faithful account of his success and it should be as much mine as i pleased i was really loath to part with him but considering the prospect of advantage which was really considerable and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any i knew i inclined to let him go but first i told him i would consult my partner and give him an answer the next day my partner and i discoursed about it and my partner made a most generous offer he told me you know it has been an unlucky ship and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again if your steward so he called my man will venture the voyage i ll leave my share of the vessel to him and let him make the best of it and if we live to meet in england and he meets with success abroad he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship s freight to us the other shall be his own if my partner who was no way concerned with my young man made him such an offer i could do no less than offer him the same and all the ship s company being willing to go with him we made over half the ship to him in property and took a writing from him obliging him to account for the other and away he went to japan the japan merchant proved a very punctual honest man to him protected him at japan and got him a licence to come on shore which the europeans in general have not lately obtained paid him his freight very punctually sent him to the philippines loaded him with japan and china wares and a supercargo of their own who trafficking with the spaniards brought back european goods again and a great quantity of cloves and other spice and there he was not only paid his freight very well and at a very good price but being not willing to sell the ship then the merchant furnished him with goods on his own account that for some money and some spices of his own which he brought with him he went back to the manillas to the spaniards where he sold his cargo very well here having gotten a good acquaintance at manilla he got his ship made a free ship and the governor of manilla hired him to go to acapulco in america on the coast of mexico and gave him a licence to land there and travel to mexico and to pass in any spanish ship to europe with all his men he made the voyage to acapulco very happily and there he sold his ship and having there also obtained allowance to travel by land to porto bello he found means some how or other to go to jamaica with all his treasure and about eight years after came to england exceeding rich of which i shall take notice in its place in the mean time i return to our particular affairs being now to part with the ship and ship s company it came before us of course to consider what recompense we should give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the design against us in the river of cambodia the truth was they had done us a considerable service and deserved well at our hands though by the way they were a couple of rogues too for as they believed the story of our being pirates and that we had really run away with the ship they came down to us not only to betray the design that was formed against us but to go to sea with us as pirates and one of them confessed afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a roguing brought him to do it however the service they did us was not the less and therefore as i had promised to be grateful to them i first ordered the money to be paid to them which they said was due to them on board their respective ships that is to say the englishman nineteen months pay and to the dutchman seven and over and above that i gave each of them a small sum of money in gold which contented them very well then i made the englishman gunner of the ship the gunner being now made second mate and purser the dutchman i made boatswain so they were both very well pleased and proved very serviceable being both able seamen and very stout fellows we were now on shore in china if i thought myself banished and remote from my own country at bengal where i had many ways to get home for my money what could i think of myself now when i was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off from home and perfectly destitute of all manner of prospect of return all we had for it was this that in about four months time there was to be another fair at that place where we were and then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the country and withal might possibly find some chinese junks or vessels from nanquin that would be to be sold and would carry us and our goods whither we pleased this i liked very well and resolved to wait besides as our particular persons were not obnoxious so if any english or dutch ships came thither perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods and get passage to some other place in india nearer home upon these hopes we resolved to continue here but to divert ourselves we took two or three journies into the country first we went ten days journey to see the city of nanquin a city well worth seeing indeed they say it has a million of people in it which however i do not believe it is regularly built the streets all exactly straight and cross one another in direct lines which gives the figure of it great advantage but when i came to compare the miserable people of these countries with ours their fabrics their manner of living their government their religion their wealth and their glory as some call it i must confess i do not so much as think it worth naming or worth my while to write of or any that shall come after me to read it is very observable that we wonder at the grandeur the riches the pomp the ceremonies the government the manufactures the commerce and the conduct of these people not that they are to be wondered at or indeed in the least to be regarded but because having first a notion of the barbarity of those countries the rudeness and the ignorance that prevail there we do not expect to find any such things so far off otherwise what are their buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of europe what their trade to the universal commerce of england holland france and spain what their cities to ours for wealth strength gaiety of apparel rich furniture and an infinite variety what are their ports supplied with a few junks and barks to our navigation our merchants fleets our large and powerful navies our city of london has more trade than all their mighty empire one english or dutch or french man of war of eighty guns would fight with and destroy all the shipping of china but the greatness of their wealth their trade the power of their government and strength of their armies are surprising to us because as i have said considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans little better than savages we did not expect such things among them and this indeed is the advantage with which all their greatness and power is represented to us otherwise it is in itself nothing at all for as i have said of their ships so it may be said of their armies and troops all the forces of their empire though they were to bring two millions of men into the field together would be able to do nothing but ruin the country and starve themselves if they were to besiege a strong town in flanders or to fight a disciplined army one line of german cuirassiers or of french cavalry would overthrow all the horse of china a million of their foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry posted so as not to be surrounded though they were not to be one to twenty in number nay i do not boast if i say that 30 000 german or english foot and 10 000 french horse would fairly beat all the forces of china and so of our fortified towns and of the art of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns there is not a fortified town in china could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an european army and at the same time all the armies of china could never take such a town as dunkirk provided it was not starved no not in ten years siege they have fire arms it is true but they are awkward clumsy and uncertain in going off they have powder but it is of no strength they have neither discipline in the field exercise in their arms skill to attack nor temper to retreat and therefore i must confess it seemed strange to me when i came home and heard our people say such fine things of the power riches glory magnificence and trade of the chinese because i saw and knew that they were a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant sordid slaves subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a people and in a word for i am now launched quite beside my design i say in a word were not its distance inconceivably great from muscovy and were not the muscovite empire almost as rude impotent and ill governed a crowd of slaves as they the czar of muscovy might with much ease drive them all out of their country and conquer them in one campaign and had the czar who i since hear is a growing prince and begins to appear formidable in the world fallen this way instead of attacking the warlike swedes in which attempt none of the powers of europe would have envied or interrupted him he might by this time have been emperor of china instead of being beaten by the king of sweden at narva when the latter was not one to six in number as their strength and their grandeur so their navigation commerce and husbandry are imperfect and impotent compared to the same things in europe also in their knowledge their learning their skill in the sciences they have globes and spheres and a smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics but when you come to inquire into their knowledge how short sighted are the wisest of their students they know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies and so grossly absurdly ignorant that when the sun is eclipsed they think it is a great dragon has assaulted and run away with it and they fall a cluttering with all the drums and kettles in the country to fright the monster away just as we do to hive a swarm of bees as this is the only excursion of this kind which i have made in all the account i have given of my travels so i shall make no more descriptions of countries and people it is none of my business or any part of my design but giving an account of my own adventures through a life of infinite wanderings and a long variety of changes which perhaps few have heard the like of i shall say nothing of the mighty places desert countries and numerous people i have yet to pass through more than relates to my own story and which my concern among them will make necessary i was now as near as i can compute in the heart of china about the latitude of thirty degrees north of the line for we were returned from nanquin i had indeed a mind to see the city of pekin which i had heard so much of and father simon importuned me daily to do it at length his time of going away being set and the other missionary who was to go with him being arrived from macao it was necessary that we should resolve either to go or not to go so i referred him to my partner and left it wholly to his choice who at length resolved it in the affirmative and we prepared for our journey we set out with very good advantage as to finding the way for we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins a kind of viceroy or principal magistrate in the province where they reside and who take great state upon them travelling with great attendance and with great homage from the people who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them because all the countries they pass through are obliged to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants that which i particularly observed as to our travelling with his baggage was this that though we received sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our horses from the country as belonging to the mandarin yet we were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the market price of the country and the mandarin s steward or commissary of the provisions collected it duly from us so that our travelling in the retinue of the mandarin though it was a very great kindness to us was not such a mighty favour in him but was indeed a great advantage to him considering there were about thirty other people travelling in the same manner besides us under the protection of his retinue or as we may call it under his convoy this i say was a great advantage to him for the country furnished all the provisions for nothing and he took all our money for them we were five and twenty days travelling to pekin through a country infinitely populous but miserably cultivated the husbandry economy and the way of living all very miserable though they boast so much of the industry of the people i say miserable and so it is if we who understand how to live were to endure it or to compare it with our own but not so to these poor wretches who know no other the pride of these people is infinitely great and exceeded by nothing but their poverty which adds to that which i call their misery i must needs think the naked savages of america live much more happy because as they have nothing so they desire nothing whereas these are proud and insolent and in the main are mere beggars and drudges their ostentation is inexpressible and is chiefly shewed in their clothes and buildings and in the keeping multitudes of servants or slaves and which is to the last degree ridiculous their contempt of all the world but themselves i must confess i travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of grand tartary than here and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept and very convenient for travellers but nothing was more awkward to me than to see such a haughty imperious insolent people in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance for all their famed ingenuity is no more my friend father simon and i used to be very merry upon these occasions to see the beggarly pride of those people for example coming by the house of a country gentleman as father simon called him about ten leagues off from the city of nanquin we had first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house about two miles the state he rode in was a perfect don quixotism being a mixture of pomp and poverty the habit of this greasy don was very proper for a scaramouch or merry andrew being a dirty calico with all the tawdry trappings of a fool s coat such as hanging sleeves taffety and cuts and slashes almost on every side it covered a rich taffety vest as greasy as a butcher and which testified that his honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven his horse was a poor lean starved hobbling creature such as in england might sell for about thirty or forty shillings and he had two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor creature along he had a whip in his hand and he belaboured the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants and we were told he was going from the city to his country seat about half a league before us we travelled on gently but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us and as we stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us when we came by the country seat of this great man we saw him in a little place before his door eating his repast it was a kind of a garden but he was easy to be seen and we were given to understand that the more we looked on him the better he would be pleased he sat under a tree something like the palmetto tree which effectually shaded him over the head and on the south side but under the tree also was placed a large umbrella which made that part look well enough he sat lolling back in a great elbow chair being a heavy corpulent man and his meat being brought him by two women slaves he had two more whose office i think few gentlemen in europe would accept of their service in viz one fed the squire with a spoon and the other held the dish with one hand and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship s beard and taffety vest with the other while the great fat brute thought it below him to employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices which kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants i took this time to think what pain men s pride puts them to and how troublesome a haughty temper thus ill managed must be to a man of common sense and leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our looking at him as if we admired his pomp whereas we really pitied and contemned him we pursued our journey only father simon had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his state which he said he had the honour to taste of and which was i think a dose that an english hound would scarce have eaten if it had been offered him viz a mess of boiled rice with a great piece of garlick in it and a little bag filled with green pepper and another plant which they have there something like our ginger but smelling like musk and tasting like mustard all this was put together and a small lump or piece of lean mutton boiled in it and this was his worship s repast four or five servants more attending at a distance if he fed them meaner than he was fed himself the spice excepted they must fare very coarsely indeed as for our mandarin with whom we travelled he was respected like a king surrounded always with his gentlemen and attended in all his appearances with such pomp that i saw little of him but at a distance but this i observed that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers pack horses in england seem to me to look much better but they were so covered with equipage mantles trappings and such like trumpery that you cannot see whether they are fat or lean in a word we could scarce see any thing but their feet and their heads i was now light hearted and all my trouble and perplexity that i had given an account of being over i had no anxious thoughts about me which made this journey much the pleasanter to me nor had i any ill accident attended me only in the passing or fording a small river my horse fell and made me free of the country as they call it that is to say threw me in the place was not deep but it wetted me all over i mention it because it spoiled my pocket book wherein i had set down the names of several people and places which i had occasion to remember and which not taking due care of the leaves rotted and the words were never after to be read to my great loss as to the names of some places which i touched at in this voyage at length we arrived at pekin i had nobody with me but the youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a servant and who proved very trusty and diligent and my partner had nobody with him but one servant who was a kinsman as for the portuguese pilot he being desirous to see the court we gave him his passage that is to say bore his charges for his company and to use him as an interpreter for he understood the language of the country and spoke good french and a little english and indeed this old man was a most useful implement to us every where for we had not been above a week at pekin when he came laughing ah seignior inglese said he i have something to tell you will make your heart glad my heart glad said i what can that be i don t know any thing in this country can either give me joy or grief to any great degree yes yes said the old man in broken english make you glad me sorrow sorry he would have said this made me more inquisitive why said i will it make you sorry because said he you have brought me here twenty five days journey and will leave me to go back alone and which way shall i get to my port afterwards without a ship without a horse without pecune so he called money being his broken latin of which he had abundance to make us merry with in short he told us there was a great caravan of muscovy and polish merchants in the city and that they were preparing to set out on their journey by land to muscovy within four or five weeks and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with them and leave him behind to go back alone i confess i was surprised with this news a secret joy spread itself over my whole soul which i cannot describe and never felt before or since and i had no power for a good while to speak a word to the old man but at last i turned to him how do you know this said i are you sure it is true yes he said i met this morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine an armenian or one you call a grecian who is among them he came last from astracan and was designing to go to tonquin where i formerly knew him but has altered his mind and is now resolved to go back with the caravan to moscow and so down the river of wolga to astracan well seignior said i do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone if this be a method for my return to england it shall be your fault if you go back to macao at all we then went to consult together what was to be done and i asked my partner what he thought of the pilot s news and whether it would suit with his affairs he told me he would do just as i would for he had settled all his affairs so well at bengal and left his effects in such good hands that as we made a good voyage here if he could vest it in china silks wrought and raw such as might be worth the carriage he would be content to go to england and then make his voyage back to bengal by the company s ships having resolved upon this we agreed that if our portuguese pilot would go with us we would bear his charges to moscow or to england if he pleased nor indeed were we to be esteemed over generous in that part neither if we had not rewarded him farther for the service he had done us was really worth all that and more for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea but he had been also like a broker for us on shore and his procuring for us the japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets so we consulted together about it and being willing to gratify him which was indeed but doing him justice and very willing also to have him with us besides for he was a most necessary man on all occasions we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold which as i compute it came to about one hundred and seventy five pounds sterling between us and to bear his charges both for himself and horse except only a horse to carry his goods having settled this among ourselves we called him to let him know what we had resolved i told him he had complained of our being like to let him go back alone and i was now to tell him we were resolved he should not go back at all that as we had resolved to go to europe with the caravan we resolved also he should go with us and that we called him to know his mind he shook his head and said it was a long journey and he had no pecune to carry him thither nor to subsist himself when he came thither we told him we believed it was so and therefore we had resolved to do something for him that would let him see how sensible we were of the service he had done us and also how agreeable he was to us and then i told him what we had resolved to give him here which he might lay out as we would do our own and that as for his charges if he would go with us we would set him safe ashore life and casualties excepted either in muscovy or in england which he would at our own charge except only the carriage of his goods he received the proposal like a man transported and told us he would go with us over the whole world and so in short we all prepared ourselves for the journey however as it was with us so it was with the other merchants they had many things to do and instead of being ready in five weeks it was four months and some odd days before all things were got together it was the beginning of february our style when we set out from pekin my partner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port where we had first put in to dispose of some goods which he had left there and i with a chinese merchant whom i had some knowledge of at nanquin and who came to pekin on his own affairs went to nanquin where i bought ninety pieces of fine damasks with about two hundred pieces of other very fine silks of several sorts some mixed with gold and had all these brought to pekin against my partner s return besides this we bought a very large quantity of raw silk and some other goods our cargo amounting in these goods only to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling which together with tea and some fine calicoes and three camel loads of nutmegs and cloves loaded in all eighteen camels for our share besides those we rode upon which with two or three spare horses and two horses loaded with provisions made us in short twenty six camels and horses in our retinue the company was very great and as near as i can remember made between three and four hundred horses and camels and upward of a hundred and twenty men very well armed and provided for all events for as the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the arabs so are these by the tartars but they are not altogether so dangerous as the arabs nor so barbarous when they prevail the company consisted of people of several nations such as muscovites chiefly for there were about sixty of them who were merchants or inhabitants of moscow though of them some were livonians and to our particular satisfaction five of them were scots who appeared also to be men of great experience in business and very good substance when we had travelled one day s journey the guides who were five in number called all the gentlemen and merchants that is to say all the passengers except the servants to a great council as they termed it at this great council every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a common stock for the necessary expense of buying forage on the way where it was not otherwise to be had and for satisfying the guides getting horses and the like and here they constituted the journey as they called it viz they named captains and officers to draw us all up and give the command in case of an attack and give every one their turn of command nor was this forming us into order any more than what we found needful upon the way as shall be observed in its place the road all on this side of the country is very populous and is full of potters and earth makers that is to say people that tempered the earth for the china ware and as i was going along our portuguese pilot who had always something or other to say to make us merry came sneering to me and told me he would shew the greatest rarity in all the country and that i should have this to say of china after all the ill humoured things i had said of it that i had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside i was very importunate to know what it was at last he told me it was a gentleman s house built all with china ware well said i are not the materials of their building the product of their own country and so it is all china ware is it not no no says he i mean it is a house all made of china ware such as you call so in england or as it is called in our country porcelain well said i such a thing may be how big is it can we carry it in a box upon a camel if we can we will buy it upon a camel said the old pilot holding up both his hands why there is a family of thirty people lives in it i was then curious indeed to see it and when i came to see it it was nothing but this it was a timber house or a house built as we call it in england with lath and plaster but all the plastering was really china ware that is to say it was plastered with the earth that makes china ware the outside which the sun shone hot upon was glazed and looked very well perfectly white and painted with blue figures as the large china ware in england is painted and hard as if it had been burnt as to the inside all the walls instead of wainscot were lined with hardened and painted tiles like the little square tiles we call gally tiles in england all made of the finest china and the figures exceeding fine indeed with extraordinary variety of colours mixed with gold many tiles making but one figure but joined so artificially with mortar being made of the same earth that it was very hard to see where the tiles met the floors of the rooms were of the same composition and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in several parts of england especially lincolnshire nottinghamshire leicestershire c as hard as stone and smooth but not burnt and painted except some smaller rooms like closets which were all as it were paved with the same tile the ceilings and in a word all the plastering work in the whole house were of the same earth and after all the roof was covered with tiles of the same but of a deep shining black this was a china warehouse indeed truly and lite rally to be called so and had i not been upon the journey i could have staid some days to see and examine the particulars of it they told me there were fountains and fish ponds in the garden all paved at the bottom and sides with the same and fine statues set up in rows on the walks entirely formed of the porcelain earth and burnt whole as this is one of the singularities of china so they may be allowed to excel in it but i am very sure they excel in their accounts of it for they told me such incredible things of their performance in crockery ware for such it is that i care not to relate as knowing it could not be true one told me in particular of a workman that made a ship with all its tackle and masts and sails in earthenware big enough to carry fifty men if he had told me he launched it and made a voyage to japan in it i might have said something to it indeed but as it was i knew the whole story which was in short asking pardon for the word that the fellow lied so i smiled and said nothing to it this odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan for which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of three shillings and told me if it had been three days journey without the wall as it was three days within he must have fined me four times as much and made me ask pardon the next council day so i promised to be more orderly for indeed i found afterwards the orders made for keeping all together were absolutely necessary for our common safety in two days more we passed the great china wall made for a fortification against the tartars and a very great work it is going over hills and mountains in an endless track where the rocks are impassable and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter or indeed climb up or where if they did no wall could hinder them they tell us its length is near a thousand english miles but that the country is five hundred in a straight measured line which the wall bounds without measuring the windings and turnings it takes tis about four fathom high and as many thick in some places i stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing on our orders for so long the caravan was in passing the gate i say i stood still an hour to look at it on every side near and far off i mean what was within my view and the guide of our caravan who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it i told him it was a most excellent thing to keep off the tartars which he happened not to understand as i meant it and so took it for a compliment but the old pilot laughed o seignior inglese said he you speak in colours in colours said i what do you mean by that why you speak what looks white this way and black that way gay one way and dull another way you tell him it is a good wall to keep out tartars you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to keep out tartars or will keep out none but tartars i understand you seignior inglese i understand you said he joking but seignior chinese understand you his own way well said i seignior do you think it would stand out an army of our country people with a good train of artillery or our engineers with two companies of miners would they not batter it down in ten days that an army might enter in battalia or blow it up in the air foundation and all that there should be no sign of it left ay ay said he i know that the chinese wanted mightily to know what i said and i gave him leave to tell him a few days after for we were then almost out of their country and he was to leave us in a little time afterwards but when he knew what i had said he was dumb all the rest of the way and we heard no more of his fine story of the chinese power and greatness while he staid after we had passed this mighty nothing called a wall something like the picts wall so famous in northumberland and built by the romans we began to find the country thinly inhabited and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities as being subject to the inroads and depredations of the tartars who rob in great armies and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open country and here i began to find the necessity of keeping together in a caravan as we travelled for we saw several troops of tartars roving about but when i came to see them distinctly i wondered how that the chinese empire could be conquered by such contemptible fellows for they are a mere herd or crowd of wild fellows keeping no order and understanding no discipline or manner of fight their horses are poor lean starved creatures taught nothing and are fit for nothing and this we found the first day we saw them which was after we entered the wilder part of the country our leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting as they call it and what was this but hunting of sheep however it may be called hunting too for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever i saw of their kind only they will not run a great way and you are sure of sport when you begin the chase for they appear generally by thirty or forty in a flock and like true sheep always keep together when they fly in pursuit of this odd sort of game it was our hap to meet with about forty tartars whether they were hunting mutton as we were or whether they looked for another kind of prey i know not but as soon as they saw us one of them blew a kind of horn very loud but with a barbarous sound that i had never heard before and by the way never care to hear again we all supposed this was to call their friends about them and so it was for in less than half a quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance but our work was over first as it happened one of the scots merchants of moscow happened to be amongst us and as soon as he heard the horn he told us in short that we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately without loss of time and drawing us up in a line he asked if we were resolved we told him we were ready to follow him so he rode directly up to them they stood gazing at us like a mere crowd drawn up in no order nor shewing the face of any order at all but as soon as they saw us advance they let fly their arrows which however missed us very happily it seems they mistook not their aim but their distance for their arrows all fell a little short of us but with so true an aim that had we been about twenty yards nearer we must have had several men wounded if not killed immediately we halted and though it was at a great distance we fired and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows following our shot full gallop resolving to fall in among them sword in hand for so our bold scot that led us directed he was indeed but a merchant but he behaved with that vigour and bravery on this occasion and yet with such a cool courage too that i never saw any man in action fitter for command as soon as we came up to them we fired our pistols in their faces and then drew but they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable the only stand any of them made was on our right where three of them stood and by signs called the rest to come back to them having a kind of scimitar in their hands and their bows hanging at their backs our brave commander without asking any body to follow him galloped up close to them and with his fusil knocked one of them off his horse killed the second with his pistol and the third ran away and thus ended our fight but we had this misfortune attending it viz that all our mutton that we had in chase got away we had not a man killed or hurt but as for the tartars there were about five of them killed how many were wounded we knew not but this we knew that the other party was so frighted with the noise of our guns that they fled and never made any attempt upon us we were all this while in the chinese dominions and therefore the tartars were not so bold as afterwards but in about five days we entered a vast great wild desert which held us three days and nights march and we were obliged to carry our water with us in great leather bottles and to encamp all night just as i have heard they do in the deserts of arabia i asked our guides whose dominion this was in and they told me this was a kind of border that might be called no man s land being part of the great karakathy or grand tartary but that however it was reckoned to china that there was no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole march though we were to go over some much larger in passing this wilderness which i confess was at the first view very frightful to me we saw two or three times little parties of the tartars but they seemed to be upon their own affairs and to have no design upon us and so like the man who met the devil if they had nothing to say to us we had nothing to say to them we let them go once however a party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us whether it was to consider what they should do viz to attack us or not attack us we knew not but when we were passed at some distance by them we made a rear guard of forty men and stood ready for them letting the caravan pass half a mile or thereabouts before us after a while they marched off only we found they assaulted us with five arrows at their parting one of which wounded a horse so that it disabled him and we left him the next day poor creature in great need of a good farrier we suppose they might shoot more arrows which might fall short of us but we saw no more arrows or tartars at that time we travelled near a month after this the ways being not so good as at first though still in the dominions of the emperor of china but lay for the most part in villages some of which were fortified because of the incursions of the tartars when we came to one of these towns it was about two days and a half s journey before we were to come to the city of naum i wanted to buy a camel of which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that road and of horses also such as they are because so many caravans coming that way they are very often wanted the person that i spoke to to get me a camel would have gone and fetched it for me but i like a fool must be officious and go myself along with him the place was about two miles out of the village where it seems they kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard i walked it on foot with my old pilot in company and a chinese being desirous forsooth of a little variety when we came to this place it was a low marshy ground walled round with a stone wall piled up dry without mortar or earth among it like a park with a little guard of chinese soldiers at the doors having bought a camel and agreed for the price i came away and the chinese man that went with me led the camel when on a sudden came up five tartars on horseback two of them seized the fellow and took the camel from him while the other three stepped up to me and my old pilot seeing us as it were unarmed for i had no weapon about me but my sword which could but ill defend me against three horsemen the first that came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword for they are arrant cowards but a second coming upon my left gave me a blow on the head which i never felt till afterwards and wondered when i came to myself what was the matter with me and where i was for he laid me flat on the ground but my never failing old pilot the portuguese so providence unlooked for directs deliverances from dangers which to us are unforeseen had a pistol in his pocket which i knew nothing of nor the tartars neither if they had i suppose they would not have attacked us but cowards are always boldest when there is no danger the old man seeing me down with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me and laying hold of his arm with one hand and pulling him down by main force a little towards him with the other he shot him into the head and laid him dead on the spot he then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us as i said and before he could come forward again for it was all done as it were in a moment made a blow at him with a scimitar which he always wore but missing the man cut his horse into the side of his head cut one of his ears off by the root and a great slice down the side of his face the poor beast enraged with the wounds was no more to be governed by his rider though the fellow sat well enough too but away he flew and carried him quite out of the pilot s reach and at some distance rising upon his hind legs threw down the tartar and fell upon him in this interval the poor chinese came in who had lost the camel but he had no weapon however seeing the tartar down and his horse fallen upon him he runs to him and seizing upon an ugly ill favoured weapon he had by his side something like a pole axe but not a pole axe either he wrenched it from him and made shift to knock his tartarian brains out with it but my old man had the third tartar to deal with still and seeing he did not fly as he expected nor come on to fight him as he apprehended but stood stock still the old man stood still too and falls to work with his tackle to charge his pistol again but as soon as the tartar saw the pistol whether he supposed it to be the same or another i know not but away he scoured and left my pilot my champion i called him afterwards a complete victory by this time i was a little awake for i thought when i first began to awake that i had been in a sweet sleep but as i said above i wondered where i was how i came upon the ground and what was the matter in a word a few minutes after as sense returned i felt pain though i did not know where i clapped my hand to my head and took it away bloody then i felt my head ache and then in another moment memory returned and every thing was present to me again i jumped up upon my feet instantly and got hold of my sword but no enemies in view i found a tartar lie dead and his horse standing very quietly by him and looking farther i saw my champion and deliverer who had been to see what the chinese had done coming back with his hanger in his hand the old man seeing me on my feet came running to me and embraced me with a great deal of joy being afraid before that i had been killed and seeing me bloody would see how i was hurt but it was not much only what we call a broken head neither did i afterwards find any great inconvenience from the blow other than the place which was hurt and which was well again in two or three days we made no great gain however by this victory for we lost a camel and gained a horse but that which was remarkable when we came back to the village the man demanded to be paid for the camel i disputed it and it was brought to a hearing before the chinese judge of the place that is to say in english we went before a justice of the peace give him his due he acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality and having heard both sides he gravely asked the chinese man that went with me to buy the camel whose servant he was i am no servant said he but went with the stranger at whose request said the justice at the stranger s request said he why then said the justice you were the stranger s servant for the time and the camel being delivered to his servant it was delivered to him and he must pay for it i confess the thing was so clear that i had not a word to say but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence and so accurate stating the case i paid willingly for the camel and sent for another but you may observe i sent for it i did not go to fetch it myself any more i had had enough of that the city of naum is a frontier of the chinese empire they call it fortified and so it is as fortifications go there for this i will venture to affirm that all the tartars in karakathy which i believe are some millions could not batter down the walls with their bows and arrows but to call it strong if it were attacked with cannon would be to make those who understand it laugh at you we wanted as i have said about two days journey of this city when messengers were sent express to every part of the road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a guard sent to them for that an unusual body of tartars making ten thousand in all had appeared in the way about thirty miles beyond the city this was very bad news to travellers however it was carefully done of the governor and we were very glad to hear we should have a guard accordingly two days after we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the chinese on our left and three hundred more from the city of naum and with those we advanced boldly the three hundred soldiers from naum marched in our front the two hundred in our rear and our men on each side of our camels with our baggage and the whole caravan in the centre in this order and well prepared for battle we thought ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand mogul tartars if they had appeared but the next day when they did appear it was quite another thing it was early in the morning when marching from a little well situated town called changu we had a river to pass where we were obliged to ferry and had the tartars had any intelligence then had been the time to have attacked us when the caravan being over the rear guard was behind but they did not appear there about three hours after when we were entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over behold by a cloud of dust they raised we saw an enemy was at hand and they were at hand indeed for they came on upon the spur the chinese our guard on the front who had talked so big the day before began to stagger and the soldiers frequently looked behind them which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run away my old pilot was of my mind and being near me he called out seignior inglese said he those fellows must be encouraged or they will ruin us all for if the tartars come on they will never stand it i am of your mind said i but what course must be done done said he let fifty of our men advance and flank them on each wing and encourage them and they will fight like brave fellows in brave company but without it they will every man turn his back immediately i rode up to our leader and told him who was exactly of our mind and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing and fifty to the left and the rest made a line of reserve for so we marched leaving the last two hundred men to make another body to themselves and to guard the camels only that if need were they should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty in a word the tartars came on and an innumerable company they were how many we could not tell but ten thousand we thought was the least a party of them came on first and viewed our posture traversing the ground in the front of our line and as we found them within gun shot our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot which was done but they went off and i suppose went back to give an account of the reception they were like to meet with and indeed that salute clogged their stomachs for they immediately halted stood awhile to consider of it and wheeling off to the left they gave over the design and said no more to us for that time which was very agreeable to our circumstances which were but very indifferent for a battle with such a number two days after this we came to the city of naum or naunm we thanked the governor for his care for us and collected to the value of one hundred crowns or thereabouts which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us and here we rested one day this is a garrison indeed and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here but the reason of it was that formerly the muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now the muscovites having abandoned that part of the country which lies from the city west for about two hundred miles as desolate and unfit for use and more especially being so very remote and so difficult to send troops hither for its defence for we had yet above two thousand miles to muscovy properly so called after this we passed several great rivers and two dreadful deserts one of which we were sixteen days passing over and which as i said was to be called no man s land and on the 13th of april we came to the frontiers of the muscovite dominions i think the first city or town or fortress whatever it might be called that belonged to the czar of muscovy was called argun being on the west side of the river argun i could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that i was now arrived in as i called it a christian country or at least in a country governed by christians for though the muscovites do in my opinion but just deserve the name of christians yet such they pretend to be and are very devout in their way it would certainly occur to any man who travels the world as i have done and who had any power of reflection i say it would occur to him to reflect what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where the name of god and of a redeemer is known worshipped and adored and not where the people given up by heaven to strong delusions worship the devil and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones worship monsters elements horrible shaped animals and statues or images of monsters not a town or city we passed through but had their pagods their idols and their temples and ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own hands now we came where at least a face of the christian worship appeared where the knee was bowed to jesus and whether ignorantly or not yet the christian religion was owned and the name of the true god was called upon and adored and it made the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it i saluted the brave scotch merchant i mentioned above with my first acknowledgment of this and taking him by the hand i said to him blessed be god we are once again come among christians he smiled and answered do not rejoice too soon countryman these muscovites are but an odd sort of christians and but for the name of it you may see very little of the substance for some months farther of our journey well said i but still it is better than paganism and worshipping of devils why i ll tell you said he except the russian soldiers in garrisons and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road all the rest of this country for above a thousand miles farther is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans and so indeed we found it we were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth if i understand any thing of the surface of the globe that is to be found in any part of the world we had at least twelve hundred miles to the sea eastward we had at least two thousand to the bottom of the baltic sea westward and almost three thousand miles if we left that sea and went on west to the british and french channels we had full five thousand miles to the indian or persian sea south and about eight hundred miles to the frozen sea north nay if some people may be believed there might be no sea north east till we came round the pole and consequently into the north west and so had a continent of land into america no mortal knows where though i could give some reasons why i believe that to be a mistake too as we entered into the muscovite dominions a good while before we came to any considerable town we had nothing to observe there but this first that all the rivers run to the east as i understood by the charts which some of our caravans had with them it was plain that all those rivers ran into the great river yamour or gammour this river by the natural course of it must run into the east sea or chinese ocean the story they tell us that the mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes of a monstrous growth viz three feet about and twenty or thirty feet high i must be allowed to say i believe nothing of but as its navigation is of no use because there is no trade that way the tartars to whom alone it belongs dealing in nothing but cattle so nobody that ever i heard or has been curious enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats or to come up from the mouth of it in ships but this is certain that this river running due east in the latitude of sixty degrees carries a vast concourse of rivers along with it and finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude so we are sure of sea there some leagues to the north of this river there are several considerable rivers whose streams run as due north as the yamour runs east and these are all found to join their waters with the great river tartarus named so from the northernmost nations of the mogul tartars who the chinese say were the first tartars in the world and who as our geographers allege are the gog and magog mentioned in sacred story these rivers running all northward as well as all the other rivers i am yet to speak of made it evident that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that side so that it does not seem rational in the least to think that the land can extend itself to join with america on that side or that there is not a communication between the northern and the eastern ocean but of this i shall say no more it was my observation at that time and therefore i take notice of it in this place we now advanced from the river arguna by easy and moderate journies and were very visibly obliged to the care the czar of muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places as are possible to place them where his soldiers keep garrison something like the stationary soldiers placed by the romans in the remotest countries of their empire some of which i had read were particularly placed in britain for the security of commerce and for the lodging of travellers and thus it was here though wherever we came at these towns and stations the garrisons and governor were russians and professed mere pagans sacrificing to idols and worshipping the sun moon and stars or all the host of heaven and not only so but were of all the heathens and pagans that ever i met with the most barbarous except only that they did not eat man s flesh as our savages of america did some instances of this we met with in the country between arguna where we enter the muscovite dominions and a city of tartars and russians together called nertzinskay in which space is a continued desert or forest which cost us twenty days to travel over it in a village near the last of those places i had the curiosity to go and see their way of living which is most brutish and unsufferable they had i suppose a great sacrifice that day for there stood out upon an old stump of a tree an idol made of wood frightful as the devil at least as any thing we can think of to represent the devil that can be made it had a head certainly not so much as resembling any creature that the world ever saw ears as big as goats horns and as high eyes as big as a crown piece and a nose like a crooked ram s horn and a mouth extended four cornered like that of a lion with horrible teeth hooked like a parrot s under bill it was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you can suppose its upper garment was of sheep skins with the wool outward a great tartar bonnet on the head with two horns growing through it it was about eight feet high yet had no feet or legs or any other proportion of parts this scarecrow was set up at the outside of the village and when i came near to it there were sixteen or seventeen creatures whether men or women i could not tell for they make no distinction by their habits either of body or head these lay all flat on the ground round this formidable block of shapeless wood i saw no motion among them any more than if they had been logs of wood like their idol at first i really thought they had been so but when i came a little nearer they started up upon their feet and raised a howling cry as if it had been so many deep mouthed hounds and walked away as if they were displeased at our disturbing them a little way off from this monster and at the door of a tent or hut made all of sheep skins and cow skins dried stood three butchers i thought they were such for when i came nearer to them i found they had long knives in their hands and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed and one young bullock or steer these it seems were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol and these three men priests belonging to it and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who brought the offering and were making their prayers to that stock i confess i was more moved at their stupidity and this brutish worship of a hobgoblin than ever i was at any thing in my life to see god s most glorious and best creature to whom be had granted so many advantages even by creation above the rest of the works of his hands vested with a reasonable soul and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to honour his maker and be honoured by him i say to see it sunk and degenerated to a degree so more than stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing a mere imaginary object dressed up by themselves and made terrible to themselves by their own contrivance adorned only with clouts and rags and that this should be the effect of mere ignorance wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil himself who envying his maker the homage and adoration of his creatures had deluded them into such gross surfeiting sordid and brutish things as one would think should shock nature itself but what signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts thus it was and i saw it before my eyes and there was no room to wonder at it or think it impossible all my admiration turned to rage and i rode up to the image or monster call it what you will and with my sword cut the bonnet that was on its head in two in the middle so that it hung down by one of the horns and one of our men that was with me took hold of the sheep skin that covered it and pulled at it when behold a most hideous outcry and howling ran through the village and two or three hundred people came about my ears so that i was glad to scour for it for we saw some had bows and arrows but i resolved from that moment to visit them again our caravan rested three nights at the town which was about four miles off in order to provide some horses which they wanted several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the badness of the way and our long march over the last desert so we had some leisure here to put my design in execution i communicated my project to the scots merchant of moscow of whose courage i had had a sufficient testimony as above i told him what i had seen and with what indignation i had since thought that human nature could be so degenerate i told him i was resolved if i could get but four or five men well armed to go with me to go and destroy that vile abominable idol to let them see that it had no power to help itself and consequently could not be an object of worship or to be prayed to much less help them that offered sacrifices to it he laughed at me said he your zeal may be good but what do you propose to yourself by it propose said i to vindicate the honour of god which is insulted by this devil worship but how will it vindicate the honour of god said he while the people will not be able to know what you mean by it unless you could speak to them too and tell them so and then they will fight you too i will assure you for they are desperate fellows and that especially in defence of their idolatry can we not said i do it in the night and then leave them the reasons in writing in their own language writing said he why there is not in five nations of them one man that knows any thing of a letter or how to read a word in any language or in their own wretched ignorance said i to him however i have a great mind to do it perhaps nature may draw inferences from it to them to let them see how brutish they are to worship such horrid things look you sir said he if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly you must do it but in the next place i would have you consider these wild nations of people are subjected by force to the czar of muscovy s dominion and if you do this it is ten to one but they will come by thousands to the governor of nertzinskay and complain and demand satisfaction and if he cannot give them satisfaction it is ten to one but they revolt and it will occasion a new war with all the tartars in the country this i confess put new thoughts into my head for a while but i harped upon the same string still and all that day i was uneasy to put my project in execution towards the evening the scots merchant met me by accident in our walk about the town and desired to speak with me i believe said he i have put you off your good design i have been a little concerned about it since for i abhor the idol and idolatry as much as you can do truly said i you have put it off a little as to the execution of it but you have not put it all out of my thoughts and i believe i shall do it still before i quit this place though i were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction no no said he god forbid they should deliver you up to such a crew of monsters they shall not do that neither that would be murdering you indeed why said i how would they use me use you said he i ll tell you how they served a poor russian who affronted them in their worship just as you did and whom they took prisoner after they had lamed him with an arrow that he could not run away they took him and stripped him stark naked and set him upon the top of the idol monster and stood all round him and shot as many arrows into him as would stick over his whole body and then they burnt him and all the arrows sticking in him as a sacrifice to the idol and was this the same idol said i yes said he the very same well said i i will tell you a story so i related the story of our men at madagascar and how they burnt and sacked the village there and killed man woman and child for their murdering one of our men just as it is related before and when i had done i added that i thought we ought to do so to this village he listened very attentively to the story but when i talked of doing so to that village said he you mistake very much it was not this village it was almost a hundred miles from this place but it was the same idol for they carry him about in procession all over the country well said i then that idol ought to be punished for it and it shall said i if i live this night out in a word finding me resolute he liked the design and told me i should not go alone but he would go with me but he would go first and bring a stout fellow one of his countrymen to go also with us and one said he as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish things as these in a word he brought me his comrade a scotsman whom he called captain richardson and i gave him a full account of what i had seen and also what i intended and he told me readily he would go with me if it cost him his life so we agreed to go only we three i had indeed proposed it to my partner but he declined it he said he was ready to assist me to the utmost and upon all occasions for my defence but that this was an adventure quite out of his way so i say we resolved upon our work only we three and my man servant and to put it in execution that night about midnight with all the secresy imaginable however upon second thoughts we were willing to delay it till the next night because the caravan being to set forward in the morning we supposed the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power the scots merchant as steady in his resolution to enterprise it as bold in executing brought me a tartar s robe or gown of sheep skins and a bonnet with a bow and arrows and had provided the same for himself and his countryman that the people if they saw us should not be able to determine who we were all the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter with aqua vitae gunpowder and such other materials as we could get and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition we came to the place about eleven o clock at night and found that the people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idol the night was cloudy yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same posture and place that it did before the people seemed to be all at their rest only that in the great hut or tent as we called it where we saw the three priests whom we mistook for butchers we saw a light and going up close to the door we heard people talking as if there were five or six of them we concluded therefore that if we set wildfire to the idol these men would come out immediately and run up to the place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended for it and what to do with them we knew not once we thought of carrying it away and setting fire to it at a distance but when we came to handle it we found it too bulky for our carriage so we were at a loss again the second scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut and knocking the creatures that were there on the head when they came out but i could not join with that i was against killing them if it was possible to be avoided well then said the scots merchant i will tell you what we will do we will try to make them prisoners tie their hands and make them stand and see their idol destroyed as it happened we had twine or packthread enough about us which we used to tie our fire works together with so we resolved to attack these people first and with as little noise as we could the first thing we did we knocked at the door when one of the priests coming to it we immediately seized upon him stopped his mouth and tied his hands behind him and led him to the idol where we gagged him that he might not make a noise tied his feet also together and left him on the ground two of us then waited at the door expecting that another would come out to see what the matter was but we waited so long till the third man came back to us and then nobody coming out we knocked again gently and immediately out came two more and we served them just in the same manner but were obliged to go all with them and lay them down by the idol some distance from one another when going back we found two more were come out to the door and a third stood behind them within the door we seized the two and immediately tied them when the third stepping back and crying out my scots merchant went in after him and taking out a composition we had made that would only smoke and stink he set fire to it and threw it in among them by that time the other scotsman and my man taking charge of the two men already bound and tied together also by the arm led them away to the idol and left them there to see if their idol would relieve them making haste back to us when the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind which flamed like a candle and following it in we found there were but four people left who it seems were two men and two women and as we supposed had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices they appeared in short frighted to death at least so as to sit trembling and stupid and not able to speak neither for the smoke in a word we took them bound them as we had the other and all without any noise i should have said we brought them out of the house or hut first for indeed we were not able to bear the smoke any more than they were when we had done this we carried them all together to the idol when we came there we fell to work with him and first we daubed him all over and his robes also with tar and such other stuff as we had which was tallow mixed with brimstone then we stopped his eyes and ears and mouth full of gunpowder then we wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet and then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us upon him we looked about to see if we could find any thing else to help to burn him when my scotsman remembered that by the tent or hut where the men were there lay a heap of dry forage whether straw or rushes i do not remember away he and the other scotsman ran and fetched their arms full of that when we had done this we took all our prisoners and brought them having untied their feet and ungagged their mouths and made them stand up and set them all before their monstrous idol and then set fire to the whole we stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts til the powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up and as we could perceive had split and deformed the shape of it and in a word till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log of wood and then igniting the dry forage to it we found it would be soon quite consumed so we began to think of going away but the scotsman said no we must not go for these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the fire and burn themselves with the idol so we resolved to stay till the forage was burnt down too and then we came away and left them in the morning we appeared among our fellow travellers exceeding busy in getting ready for our journey nor could any man suggest that we had been any where but in our beds as travellers might be supposed to be to fit themselves for the fatigues of that day s journey but it did not end so for the next day came a great multitude of the country people not only of this village but of a hundred more for aught i know to the town gates and in a most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the russian governor for the insulting their priests and burning their great cham chi thaungu such a hard name they gave the monstrous creature they worshipped the people of nertzinskay were at first in a great consternation for they said the tartars were no less than thirty thousand and that in a few days more they would be one hundred thousand stronger the russian governor sent out messengers to appease them and gave them all the good words imaginable he assured them he knew nothing of it and that there had not a soul of his garrison been abroad that it could not be from any body there and if they would let him know who it was he should be exemplarily punished they returned haughtily that all the country reverenced the great cham chi thaungu who dwelt in the son and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image but some christian miscreant so they called them it seems and they therefore denounced war against him and all the russians who they said were miscreants and christians the governor still patient and unwilling to make a breach or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him the czar having straitly charged him to treat the conquered country with gentleness and civility gave them still all the good words he could at last he told them there was a caravan gone towards russia that morning and perhaps it was some of them who had done them this injury and that if they would be satisfied with that he would send after them to inquire into it this seemed to appease them a little and accordingly the governor sent after us and gave us a particular account how the thing was intimating withal that if any in our caravan had done it they should make their escape but that whether they had done it or no we should make all the haste forward that was possible and that in the meantime he would keep them in play as long as he could this was very friendly in the governor however when it came to the caravan there was nobody knew any thing of the matter and as for us that were guilty we were the least of all suspected none so much as asked us the question however the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the governor gave us and we marched or travelled two days and two nights without any considerable stop and then we lay at a village called plothus nor did we make any long stop here but hastened on towards jarawena another of the czar of muscovy s colonies and where we expected we should be safe but it is to be observed that here we began for two or three days march to enter upon a vast nameless desert of which i shall say more in its place and which if we had now been upon it it is more than probable we had been all destroyed it was the second day s march from plothus that by the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance some of our people began to be sensible we were pursued we had entered the desert and had passed by a great lake called schanks osier when we perceived a very great body of horse appear on the other side of the lake to the north we travelling west we observed they went away west as we did but had supposed we should have taken that side of the lake whereas we very happily took the south side and in two days more we saw them not for they believing we were still before them pushed on till they came to the river udda this is a very great river when it passes farther north but when we came to it we found it narrow and fordable the third day they either found their mistake or had intelligence of us and came pouring in upon us towards the dusk of the evening we had to our great satisfaction just pitched upon a place for our camp which was very convenient for the night for as we were upon a desert though but at the beginning of it that was above five hundred miles over we had no towns to lodge at and indeed expected none but the city of jarawena which we had yet two days march to the desert however had some few woods in it on this side and little river which ran all into the great river udda it was in a narrow strait between two small but very thick woods that we pitched our little camp for that night expecting to be attacked in the night nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for but as it was usual for the mogul tartars to go about in troops in that desert so the caravans always fortify themselves every night against them as against armies of robbers and it was therefore no new thing to be pursued but we had this night of all the nights of our travels a most advantageous camp for we lay between two woods with a little rivulet running just before our front so that we could not be surrounded or attacked any way but in our front or rear we took care also to make our front as strong as we could by placing our packs with our camels and horses all in a line on the side of the river and we felled some trees in our rear in this posture we encamped for the night but the enemy was upon us before we had finished our situation they did not come on us like thieves as we expected but sent three messengers to us to demand the men to be delivered to them that had abused their priests and burnt their god cham chi thaungu that they might burn them with fire and upon this they said they would go away and do us no farther harm otherwise they would burn us all with fire our men looked very blank at this message and began to stare at one another to see who looked with most guilt in their faces but nobody was the word nobody did it the leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured it was not done by any of our camp that we were peaceable merchants travelling on our business that we had done no harm to them or to any one else and therefore they must look farther for their enemies who had injured them for we were not the people so desired them not to disturb us for if they did we should defend ourselves they were far from being satisfied with this for an answer and a great crowd of them came down in the morning by break of day to our camp but seeing us in such an advantageous situation they durst come no farther than the brook in our front where they stood and shewed us such a number as indeed terrified us very much for those that spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand here they stood and looked at us awhile and then setting up a great howl they let fly a cloud of arrows among us but we were well enough fortified for that for we were sheltered under our baggage and i do not remember that one man of us was hurt some time after this we saw them move a little to our right and expected them on the rear when a cunning fellow a cossack as they call them of jarawena in the pay of the muscovites calling to the leader of the caravan said to him i will send all these people away to sibeilka this was a city four or five days journey at least to the south and rather behind us so he takes his bow and arrows and getting on horseback he rides away from our rear directly as it were back to nertzinskay after this he takes a great circuit about and comes to the army of the tartars as if he had been sent express to tell them a long story that the people who had burnt their cham chi thaungu were gone to sibeilka with a caravan of miscreants as he called them that is to say christians and that they were resolved to burn the god seal isarg belonging to the tonguses as this fellow was a mere tartar and perfectly spoke their language he counterfeited so well that they all took it from him and away they drove in a most violent hurry to sibeilka which it seems was five days journey to the south and in less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight and we never heard any more of them nor ever knew whether they went to that other place called sibeilka or no so we passed safely on to the city of jarawena where there was a garrison of muscovites and there we rested five days the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day s march and with want of rest in the night from this city we had a frightful desert which held us three and twenty days march we furnished ourselves with some tents here for the better accommodating ourselves in the night and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages or waggons of the country for carrying our water and provisions and these carriages were our defence every night round our little camp so that had the tartars appeared unless they had been very numerous indeed they would not have been able to hurt us we may well be supposed to want rest again after this long journey for in this desert we saw neither house or tree or scarce a bush we saw indeed abundance of the sable hunters as they called them these are all tartars of the mogul tartary of which this country is a part and they frequently attack small caravans but we saw no numbers of them together i was curious to see the sable skins they catched but i could never speak with any of them for they durst not come near us neither durst we straggle from our company to go near them after we had passed this desert we came into a country pretty well inhabited that is to say we found towns and castles settled by the czar of muscovy with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect the caravans and defend the country against the tartars who would otherwise make it very dangerous travelling and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and merchants that if there are any tartars heard of in the country detachments of the garrison are always sent to see travellers safe from station to station and thus the governor of adinskoy whom i had an opportunity to make a visit to by means of the scots merchant who was acquainted with him offered us a guard of fifty men if we thought there was any danger to the next station i thought long before this that as we came nearer to europe we should find the country better peopled and the people more civilized but i found myself mistaken in both for we had yet the nation of the tonguses to pass through where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity or worse than before only as they were conquered by the muscovites and entirely reduced they were not so dangerous but for the rudeness of manners idolatry and polytheism no people in the world ever went beyond them they are clothed all in skins of beasts and their houses are built of the same you know not a man from a woman neither by the ruggedness of their countenances or their clothes and in the winter when the ground is covered with snow they live under ground in houses like vaults which have cavities or caves going from one to another if the tartars had their cham chi thaungu for a whole village or country these had idols in every hut and every cave besides they worship the stars the sun the water the snow and in a word every thing that they do not understand and they understand but very little so that almost every element every uncommon thing sets them a sacrificing but i am no more to describe people than countries any farther than my own story comes to be concerned in them i met with nothing peculiar to myself in all this country which i reckon was from the desert which i spoke of last at least four hundred miles half of it being another desert which took us up twelve days severe travelling without house tree or bush but we were obliged again to carry our own provisions as well water as bread after we were out of this desert and had travelled two days we came to janezay a muscovite city or station on the great river janezay this river they told us parted europe from asia though our map makers as i am told do not agree to it however it is certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient siberia which now makes a province only of the vast muscovite empire but is itself equal in bigness to the whole empire of germany and yet here i observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed except in the muscovite garrisons all the country between the river oby and the river janezay is as entirely pagan and the people as barbarous as the remotest of the tartars nay as any nation for aught i know in asia or america i also found which i observed to the muscovite governors whom i had opportunity to converse with that the pagans are not much the wiser or the nearer christianity for being under the muscovite government which they acknowledged was true enough but they said it was none of their business that if the czar expected to convert his siberian or tonguese or tartar subjects it should be done by sending clergymen among them not soldiers and they added with more sincerity than i expected that they found it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make the people christians as it was to make them subjects from this river to the great river oby we crossed a wild uncultivated country i cannot say tis a barbarous soil tis only barren of people and wants good management otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant fruitful and agreeable country what inhabitants we found in it are all pagans except such as are sent among them from russia for this is the country i mean on both sides the river oby whither the muscovite criminals that are not put to death are banished and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever come away i have nothing material to say of my particular affairs till i came to tobolski the capital of siberia where i continued some time on the following occasion we had been now almost seven months on our journey and winter began to come on apace whereupon my partner and i called a council about our particular affairs in which we found it proper considering that we were bound for england and not for moscow to consider how to dispose of ourselves they told us of sledges and rein deer to carry us over the snow in the winter time and indeed they have such things as it would be incredible to relate the particulars of by which means the russians travel more in the winter than they can in summer because in these sledges they are able to run night and day the snow being frozen is one universal covering to nature by which the hills the vales the rivers the lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone and they run upon the surface without any regard to what is underneath but i had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind i was bound to england not to moscow and my route lay two ways either i must go on as the caravan went till i came to jarislaw and then go off west for narva and the gulf of finland and so either by sea or land to dantzic where i might possibly sell my china cargo to good advantage or i must leave the caravan at a little town on the dwina from whence i had but six days by water to archangel and from thence might be sure of shipping either to england holland or hamburgh now to go any of these journies in the winter would have been preposterous for as to dantzic the baltic would be frozen up and i could not get passage and to go by land in those countries was far less safe than among the mogul tartars likewise to archangel in october all the ships would be gone from thence and even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire south to moscow in the winter when the ships are gone so that i should have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter with a scarcity of provisions and must lie there in an empty town all the winter so that upon the whole i thought it much my better way to let the caravan go and to make provision to winter where i was viz at tobolski in siberia in the latitude of sixty degrees where i was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with viz plenty of provisions such as the country afforded a warm house with fuel enough and excellent company of all which i shall give a full account in its place i was now in a quite different climate from my beloved island where i never felt cold except when i had my ague on the contrary i had much to do to bear my clothes on my back and never made any fire but without doors for my necessity in dressing my food c now i made me three good vests with large robes or gowns over them to hang down to the feet and button close to the wrists and all these lined with furs to make them sufficiently warm as to a warm house i must confess i greatly dislike our way in england of making fires in every room in the house in open chimnies which when the fire was out always kept the air in the room cold as the climate but taking an apartment in a good house in the town i ordered a chimney to be built like a furnace in the centre of six several rooms like a stove the funnel to carry the smoke went up one way the door to come at the fire went in another and all the rooms were kept equally warm but no fire seen like as they heat the bagnios in england by this means we had always the same climate in all the rooms and an equal heat was preserved and how cold soever it was without it was always warm within and yet we saw no fire nor were ever incommoded with any smoke the most wonderful thing of all was that it should be possible to meet with good company here in a country so barbarous as that of the most northerly part of europe near the frozen ocean and within but a very few degrees of nova zembla but this being the country where the state criminals of muscovy as i observed before are all banished this city was full of noblemen princes gentlemen colonels and in short all degrees of the nobility gentry soldiery and courtiers of muscovy here were the famous prince galilfken or galoffken and his son the old general robostisky and several other persons of note and some ladies by means of my scots merchant whom nevertheless i parted with here i made an acquaintance with several of these gentlemen and some of them of the first rank and from these in the long winter nights in which i staid here i received several agreeable visits it was talking one night with a certain prince one of the banished ministers of state belonging to the czar of muscovy that my talk of my particular case began he had been telling me abundance of fine things of the greatness the magnificence and dominions and the absolute power of the emperor of the russians i interrupted him and told him i was a greater and more powerful prince than ever the czar of muscovy was though my dominions were not so large or my people so many the russian grandee looked a little surprised and fixing his eyes steadily upon me began to wonder what i meant i told him his wonder would cease when i had explained myself first i told him i had the absolute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects that notwithstanding my absolute power i had not one person disaffected to my government or to my person in all my dominions he shook his head at that and said there indeed i outdid the czar of muscovy i told him that all the lands in my kingdom were my own and all my subjects were not only my tenants but tenants at will that they would all fight for me to the last drop and that never tyrant for such i acknowledged myself to be was ever so universally beloved and yet so horribly feared by his subjects after amusing them with these riddles in government for awhile i opened the case and told them the story at large of my living in the island and how i managed both myself and the people there that were under me just as i have since minuted it down they were exceedingly taken with the story and especially the prince who told me with a sigh that the true greatness of life was to be master of ourselves that he would not have changed such a state of life as mine to have been czar of muscovy and that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to be banished to there than ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the czar that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to our circumstances and to make a calm within under the weight of the greatest storm without when he came first hither he said he used to tear the hair from his head and the clothes from his back as others had done before him but a little time and consideration had made him look into himself as well as round himself to things without that he found the mind of man if it was but once brought to reflect upon the state of universal life and how little this world was concerned in its true felicity was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself fully satisfying to itself and suitable to its own best ends and desires with but very little assistance from the world that air to breathe in food to sustain life clothes for warmth and liberty for exercise in order to health completed in his opinion all that the world could do for us and though the greatness the authority the riches and the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world and which he had enjoyed his share of had much in them that was agreeable to us yet he observed that all those things chiefly gratified the coarsest of our affections such as our ambition our particular pride our avarice our vanity and our sensuality all which were indeed the mere product of the worst part of man were in themselves crimes and had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes but neither were related to or concerned with any of those virtues that constituted us wise men or of those graces which distinguished us as christians that being now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them where he found all manner of deformity and was now convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise rich and great and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future state and in this he said they were more happy in their banishment than all their enemies were who had the full possession of all the wealth and power that they the banished had left behind them nor sir said he do i bring my mind to this politically by the necessity of my circumstances which some call miserable but if i know any thing of myself i would not go back no not though my master the czar should call me and offer to reinstate me in all my former grandeur i say i would no more go back to it than i believe my soul when it shall be delivered from this prison of the body and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human affairs he spake this with so much warmth in his temper so much earnestness and motion of his spirits which were apparent in his countenance that it was evident it was the true sense of his soul and indeed there was no room to doubt his sincerity i told him i once thought myself a kind of a monarch in my old station of which i had given him an account but that i thought he was not a monarch only but a great conqueror for that he that has got a victory over his own exorbitant desires and has the absolute dominion over himself and whose reason entirely governs his will is certainly greater than he that conquers a city but my lord said i shall i take the liberty to ask you a question with all my heart said he if the door of your liberty was opened said i would not you take hold of it to deliver yourself from this exile hold said he your question is subtle and requires some serious just distinctions to give it a sincere answer and i ll give it you from the bottom of my heart nothing that i know of in this world would move me to deliver myself from the state of banishment except these two first the enjoyment of my relations and secondly a little warmer climate but i protest to you that to go back to the pomp of the court the glory the power the hurry of a minister of state the wealth the gaiety and the pleasures that is to say follies of a courtier if my master should send me word this moment that he restores me to all he banished me from i protest if i know myself at all i would not leave this wilderness these deserts and these frozen lakes for the palace of moscow but my lord said i perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures of the court and from the power and authority and wealth you enjoyed before but you may be absent too from some of the conveniencies of life your estate perhaps confiscated and your effects plundered and the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life ay said he that is as you suppose me to be a lord or a prince c so indeed i am but you are now to consider me only as a man a human creature not at all distinguished from another and so i can suffer no want unless i should be visited with sickness and distempers however to put the question out of dispute you see our manner we are in this place five persons of rank we live perfectly retired as suited to a state of banishment we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for our food but the poor soldiers who are here without that help live in as much plenty as we they go into the woods and catch sables and foxes the labour of a month will maintain them a year and as the way of living is not expensive so it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves so that objection is out of doors i have no room to give a full account of the most agreeable conversation i had with this truly great man in all which he shewed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge of things so supported by religion as well as by a vast share of wisdom that his contempt of the world was really as much as he had expressed and that he was always the same to the last as will appear in the story i am going to tell i had been here eight months and a dark dreadful winter i thought it to be the cold was so intense that i could not so much as look abroad without being wrapt in furs and a mask of fur before my face or rather a hood with only a hole for breath and two for sight the little daylight we had as we reckoned for three months not above five hours a day or six at most only that the snow lying on the ground continually and the weather being clear it was never quite dark our horses were kept or rather starved under ground and as for our servants for we hired servants here to look after our horses and ourselves we had every now and then their fingers and toes to thaw and take care of lest they should mortify and fall off it is true within doors we were warm the houses being close the walls thick the lights small and the glass all double our food was chiefly the flesh of deer dried and cured in the season good bread enough but baked as biscuits dried fish of several sorts and some flesh of mutton and of buffaloes which is pretty good beef all the stores of provision for the winter are laid up in the summer and well cured our drink was water mixed with aqua vitae instead of brandy and for a treat mead instead of wine which however they have excellent good the hunters who ventured abroad all weathers frequently brought us in fresh venison very fat and good and sometimes bear s flesh but we did not much care for the last we had a good stock of tea with which we treated our friends as above and in a word we lived very cheerfully and well all things considered it was now march and the days grown considerably longer and the weather at least tolerable so other travellers began to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow and to get things ready to be going but my measures being fixed as i have said for archangel and not for muscovy or the baltic i made no motion knowing very well that the ships from the south do not set out for that part of the world till may or june and that if i was there at the beginning of august it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away and therefore i say i made no haste to be gone as others did in a word i saw a great many people nay all the travellers go away before me it seems every year they go from thence to moscow for trade viz to carry furs and buy necessaries with them which they bring back to furnish their shops also others went on the same errand to archangel but then they also being to come back again above eight hundred miles went all out before me in short about the latter end of may i began to make all ready to pack up and as i was doing this it occurred to me that seeing all these people were banished by the czar of muscovy to siberia and yet when they came there were at liberty to go whither they would why did they not then go away to any part of the world wherever they thought fit and i began to examine what should hinder them from making such an attempt but my wonder was over when i entreated upon that subject with the person i have mentioned who answered me thus consider first said he the place where we are and secondly the condition we are in especially said he the generality of the people who are banished hither we are surrounded said he with stronger things than bars and bolts on the north side is an unnavigable ocean where ship never sailed and boat never swam neither if we had both could we know whither to go with them every other way said he we have above a thousand miles to pass through the czar s own dominions and by ways utterly impassable except by the roads made by the government and through the towns garrisoned by its troops so that we could neither pass undiscovered by the road or subsist any other way so that it is in vain to attempt it i was silenced indeed at once and found that they were in a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle of moscow however it came into my thoughts that i might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent person and that it was very easy for me to carry him away there being no guard over him in the country and as i was not going to moscow but to archangel and that i went in the nature of a caravan by which i was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the desert but could encamp every night where i would might easily pass uninterrupted to archangel where i could immediately secure him on board an english or dutch ship and carry him off safe along with me and as to his subsistence and other particulars that should be my care till he should better supply himself he heard me very attentively and looked earnestly on me all the while i spoke nay i could see in his very face that what i said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment his colour frequently changed his eyes looked red and his heart fluttered that it might be even perceived in his countenance nor could he immediately answer me when i had done and as it were expected what he would say to it and after he had paused a little he embraced me and said how unhappy are we unguided creatures as we are that even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares to us and we are made tempters of one another my dear friend said he your offer is so sincere has such kindness in it is so disinterested in itself and is so calculated for my advantage that i must have very little knowledge of the world if i did not both wonder at it and acknowledge the obligation i have upon me to you for it but did you believe i was sincere in what i have so often said to you of my contempt of the world did you believe i spoke my very soul to you and that i had really maintained that degree of felicity here that had placed me above all that the world could give me or do for me did you believe i was sincere when i told you i would not go back if i was recalled even to be all that once i was in the court and with the favour of the czar my master did you believe me my friend to be an honest man or did you think me to be a boasting hypocrite here he stopped as if he would hear what i would say but indeed i soon after perceived that he stopped because his spirits were in motion his heart was full of struggles and he could not go on i was i confess astonished at the thing as well as at the man and i used some arguments with him to urge him to set himself free that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by heaven for his deliverance and a summons by providence who has the care and good disposition of all events to do himself good and to render himself useful in the world he had by this time recovered himself how do you know sir said he warmly but that instead of a summons from heaven it may be a feint of another instrument representing in all the alluring colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance which may in itself be my snare and tend directly to my ruin here i am free from the temptation of returning to my former miserable greatness there i am not sure but that all the seeds of pride ambition avarice and luxury which i know remain in my nature may revive and take root and in a word again overwhelm me and then the happy prisoner whom you see now master of his soul s liberty shall be the miserable slave of his own senses in the full possession of all personal liberty dear sir let me remain in this blessed confinement banished from the crimes of life rather than purchase a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of my reason and at the expense of the future happiness which now i have in my view but shall then i fear quickly lose sight of for i am but flesh a man a mere man have passions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me as any man o be not my friend and my tempter both together if i was surprised before i was quite dumb now and stood silent looking at him and indeed admired what i saw the struggle in his soul was so great that though the weather was extremely cold it put him into a most violent sweat and i found he wanted to give vent to his mind so i said a word or two that i would leave him to consider of it and wait on him again and then i withdrew to my own apartment about two hours after i heard somebody at or near the door of the room and i was going to open the door but he had opened it and come in my dear friend said he you had almost overset me but i am recovered do not take it ill that i do not close with your offer i assure you it is not for want of a sense of the kindness of it in you and i come to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you but i hope i have got the victory over myself my lord said i i hope you are fully satisfied that you did not resist the call of heaven sir said he if it had been from heaven the same power would have influenced me to accept it but i hope and am fully satisfied that it is from heaven that i decline it and i have an infinite satisfaction in the parting that you shall leave me an honest man still though not a free man i had nothing to do but to acquiesce and make profession to him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him he embraced me very passionately and assured me he was sensible of that and should always acknowledge it and with that he offered me a very fine present of sables too much indeed for me to accept from a man in his circumstances and i would have avoided them but he would not be refused the next morning i sent my servant to his lordship with a small present of tea two pieces of china damask and four little wedges of japan gold which did not all weigh above six ounces or thereabouts but were far short of the value of his sables which indeed when i came to england i found worth near two hundred pounds he accepted the tea and one piece of the damask and one of the pieces of gold which had a fine stamp upon it of the japan coinage which i found he took for the rarity of it but would not take any more and sent word by my servant that he desired to speak with me when i came to him he told me i knew what had passed between us and hoped i would not move him any more in that affair but that since i made such a generous offer to him he asked me if i had kindness enough to offer the same to another person that he would name to me in whom he had a great share of concern i told him that i could not say i inclined to do so much for any one but himself for whom i had a particular value and should have been glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance however if he would please to name the person to me i would give him my answer and hoped he would not be displeased with me if he was with my answer he told me it was only his son who though i had not seen yet was in the same condition with himself and above two hundred miles from him on the other side the oby but that if i consented he would send for him i made no hesitation but told him i would do it i made some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his account and that seeing i could not prevail on him i would shew my respect to him by my concern for his son but these things are too tedious to repeat here he sent away the next day for his son and in about twenty days he came back with the messenger bringing six or seven horses loaded with very rich furs and which in the whole amounted to a very great value his servants brought the horses into the town but left the young lord at a distance till night when he came incognito into our apartment and his father presented him to me and in short we concerted there the manner of our travelling and every thing proper for the journey i had bought a considerable quantity of sables black fox skins fine ermines and such other furs that are very rich i say i had bought them in that city for exchange for some of the goods brought from china in particular for the cloves and nutmegs of which i sold the greatest part here and the rest afterwards at archangel for a much better price than i could have done at louden and my partner who was sensible of the profit and whose business more particularly than mine was merchandise was mightily pleased with our stay on account of the traffic we made here it was in the beginning of june when i left this remote place a city i believe little heard of in the world and indeed it is so far out of the road of commerce that i know not how it should be much talked of we were now come to a very small caravan being only thirty two horses and camels in all and all of them passed for mine though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them it was most natural also that i should take more servants with me than i had before and the young lord passed for my steward what great man i passed for myself i know not neither did it concern me to inquire we had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in all the journey indeed i call it the worst because the way was very deep in some places and very uneven in others the best we had to say for it was that we thought we had no troops of tartars and robbers to fear and that they never came on this side the river oby or at least but very seldom but we found it otherwise my young lord had with him a faithful muscovite servant or rather a siberian servant who was perfectly acquainted with the country and who led us by private roads that we avoided coming into the principal towns and cities upon the great road such as tumen soloy kamaskoy and several others because the muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and strict in their observation upon travellers and searching lest any of the banished persons of note should make their escape that way into muscovy but by this means as we were kept out of the cities so our whole journey was a desert and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents when we might have had good accommodation in the cities on the way this the young lord was so sensible of that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we came to several cities on the way but lay abroad himself with his servant in the woods and met us always at the appointed places we were just entered europe having passed the river kama which in these parts is the boundary between europe and asia and the first city on the european side was called soloy kamaskoy which is as much as to say the great city on the river kama and here we thought to have seen some evident alteration in the people their manners their habit their religion and their business but we were mistaken for as we had a vast desert to pass which by relation is near seven hundred miles long in some places but not above two hundred miles over where we passed it so till we came past that horrible place we found very little difference between that country and the mogul tartary the people mostly pagans and little better than the savages of america their houses and towns full of idols and their way of living wholly barbarous except in the cities as above and the villages near them where they are christians as they call themselves of the greek church but even these have their religion mingled with so many relics of superstition that it is scarce to be known in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft in passing this forest i thought indeed we must after all our dangers were in our imagination escaped as before have been plundered and robbed and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves of what country they were whether the roving bands of the ostiachi a kind of tartars or wild people on the banks of the oby had ranged thus far or whether they were the sable hunters of siberia i am yet at a loss to know but they were all on horseback carried bows and arrows and were at first about five and forty in number they came so near to us as within about two musket shot and asking no questions they surrounded us with their horses and looked very earnestly upon us twice at length they placed themselves just in our way upon which we drew up in a little line before our camels being not above sixteen men in all and being drawn up thus we halted and sent out the siberian servant who attended his lord to see who they were his master was the more willing to let him go because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a siberian troop sent out after him the man came up near them with a flag of truce and called to them but though he spoke several of their languages or dialects of languages rather he could not understand a word they said however after some signs to him not to come nearer to them at his peril so he said he understood them to mean offering to shoot at him if he advanced the fellow came back no wiser than he went only that by their dress he said he believed them to be some tartars of kalmuck or of the circassian hordes and that there must be more of them on the great desert though he never heard that ever any of them were seen so far north before this was small comfort to us however we had no remedy there was on our left hand at about a quarter of a mile s distance a little grove or clump of trees which stood close together and very near the road i immediately resolved we should advance to those trees and fortify ourselves as well as we could there for first i considered that the trees would in a great measure cover us from their arrows and in the next place they could not come to charge us in a body it was indeed my old portuguese pilot who proposed it and who had this excellency attending him namely that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger we advanced immediately with what speed we could and gained that little wood the tartars or thieves for we knew not what to call them keeping their stand and not attempting to hinder us when we came thither we found to our great satisfaction that it was a swampy springy piece of ground and on the other side a great spring of water which running out in a little rill or brook was a little farther joined by another of the like bigness and was in short the head or source of a considerable river called afterwards the wirtska the trees which grew about this spring were not in all above two hundred but were very large and stood pretty thick so that as soon as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they alighted and attacked us on foot but to make this more difficult our portuguese with indefatigable application cut down great arms of the trees and laid them hanging not cut quite off from one tree to another so that he made a continued fence almost round us we staid here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours without perceiving they made any offer to stir when about two hours before night they came down directly upon us and though we had not perceived it we found they had been joined by some more of the same so that they were near fourscore horse whereof however we fancied some were women they came in till they were within half a shot of our little wood when we fired one musket without ball and called to them in the russian tongue to know what they wanted and bid them keep off but as if they knew nothing of what we said they came on with a double fury directly to the wood side not imagining we were so barricaded that they could not break in our old pilot was our captain as well as he had been our engineer and desired of us not to fire upon them till they came within pistol shot that we might be sure to kill and that when we did fire we should be sure to take good aim we bade him give the word of command which he delayed so long that they were some of them within two pikes length of us when we fired we aimed so true or providence directed our shot so sure that we killed fourteen of them at the first volley and wounded several others as also several of their horses for we had all of us loaded our pieces with two or three bullets apiece at least they were terribly surprised with our fire and retreated immediately about one hundred rods from us in which time we loaded our pieces again and seeing them keep that distance we sallied out and caught four or five of their horses whose riders we supposed were killed and coming up to the dead we could easily perceive they were tartars but knew not from what country or how they came to make an excursion such an unusual length about an hour after they made a motion to attack us again and rode round our little wood to see where else they might break in but finding us always ready to face them they went off again and we resolved not to stir from the place for that night we slept but little you may be sure but spent the most part of the night in strengthening our situation and barricading the entrances into the wood and keeping a strict watch we waited for daylight and when it came it gave us a very unwelcome discovery indeed for the enemy who we thought were discouraged with the reception they had met with were now increased to no less than three hundred and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents as if they were resolved to besiege us and this little camp they had pitched was upon the open plain at about three quarters of a mile from us we were indeed surprised at this discovery and now i confess i gave myself over for lost and all that i had the loss of my effects did not lie so near me though they were very considerable as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my journey after so many difficulties and hazards as i had gone through and even in sight of our port where we expected safety and deliverance as for my partner he was raging he declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin and he would rather die than be starved and he was for fighting to the last drop the young lord as gallant as ever flesh shewed itself was for fighting to the last also and my old pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them all in the situation we then were in and thus we spent the day in debates of what we should do but towards evening we found that the number of our enemies still increased perhaps as they were abroad in several parties for prey the first had sent out scouts to call for help and to acquaint them of their booty and we did not know but by the morning they might still be a greater number so i began to inquire of those people we had brought from tobolski if there were no other or more private ways by which we might avoid them in the night and perhaps either retreat to some town or get help to guard us over the desert the siberian who was servant to the young lord told us if we designed to avoid them and not fight he would engage to carry us off in the night to a way that went north towards the river petraz by which he made no doubt but we might get away and the tartars never the wiser but he said his lord had told him he would not return but would rather choose to fight i told him he mistook his lord for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it that i knew his lord was brave enough by what he had shewed already but that his lord knew better than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men fight five hundred unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it and that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the night we had nothing else to do but to attempt it he answered if his lord gave him such order he would lose his life if he did not perform it we soon brought his lord to give that order though privately and we immediately prepared for the putting it in practice and first as soon as it began to be dark we kindled a fire in our little camp which we kept burning and prepared so as to make it burn all night that the tartars might conclude we were still there but as soon as it was dark that is to say so as we could see the stars for our guide would not stir before having all our horses and camels ready loaded we followed our new guide who i soon found steered himself by the pole or north star all the country being level for a long way after we had travelled two hours very hard it began to be lighter still not that it was quite dark all night but the moon began to rise so that in short it was rather lighter than we wished it to be but by six o clock next morning we were gotten near forty miles though the truth is we almost spoiled our horses here we found a russian village named kirmazinskoy where we rested and heard nothing of the kalmuck tartars that day about two hours before night we set out again and travelled till eight the next morning though not quite so hastily as before and about seven o clock we passed a little river called kirtza and came to a good large town inhabited by russians and very populous called ozomya there we heard that several troops or herds of kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert but that we were now completely out of danger of them which was to our great satisfaction you may be sure here we were obliged to get some fresh horses and having need enough of rest we staid five days and my partner and i agreed to give the honest siberian who brought us hither the value of ten pistoles for his conducting us in five days more we came to veussima upon the river witzogda which running into the river dwina we were there very happily near the end of our travels by land that river being navigable in seven days passage to archangel from hence we came to lawrenskoy where the river joins the third of july and provided ourselves with two luggage boats and a barge for our convenience we embarked the seventh and arrived all safe at archangel the eighteenth having been a year five months and three days on the journey including our stay of eight months and odd days at tobolski we were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the ships and must have tarried longer had not a hamburgher come in above a month sooner than any of the english ships when after some consideration that the city of hamburgh might happen to be as good a market for our goods as london we all took freight with him and having put our goods on board it was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take care of them by which means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself never coming on shore again in all the time we staid there and this he did that he might not be seen in the city where some of the moscow merchants would certainly have seen and discovered him we sailed from archangel the twentieth of august the same year and after no extraordinary bad voyage arrived in the elbe the thirteenth of september here my partner and i found a very good sale for our goods as well those of china as the sables c of siberia and dividing the produce of our effects my share amounted to 3475 l 17 s 3 d notwithstanding so many losses we had sustained and charges we had been at only remembering that i had included in this about 600 l worth of diamonds which i had purchased at bengal here the young lord took his leave of us and went up to the elbe in order to go to the court of vienna where he resolved to seek protection and where he could correspond with those of his father s friends who were left alive he did not part without all the testimonies he could give of gratitude for the service i had done him and his sense of my kindness to the prince his father to conclude having staid near four mouths in hamburgh i came from thence over land to the hague where i embarked in the packet and arrived in london the tenth of january 1705 having been gone from england ten years and nine months and here resolving to harass myself no more i am preparing for a longer journey than all these having lived seventy two years a life of infinite variety and learnt sufficiently to know the value of retirement and the blessing of ending our days in peace '"
